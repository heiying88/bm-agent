//! In-process Rust SDK quick-start — the same agent loop the server runs, with
//! no HTTP and no server process.
//!
//! This is the compile-checked twin of the "Use it as a Rust SDK (in-process)"
//! section in the crate README: if the README snippet drifts from the real API,
//! this example stops compiling. Run it against a configured data dir:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo run --example sdk_quickstart
//! ```
//!
//! It requires `~/.bamboo/config.json` to define a provider + API key (the same
//! config `bamboo serve` reads); `with_defaults_for_data_dir` wires the runtime
//! dependencies from that directory.
//!
//! This example also demonstrates the two interactive capabilities layered on
//! top of "start a run and stream events" (bamboo-agent#244):
//!
//! - **Cancellation**: `run_stream_cancellable` hands back a `CancellationToken`
//!   alongside the event receiver; a background watchdog cancels the run if it
//!   runs unexpectedly long.
//! - **Approval / clarification + resume**: if the model calls a tool that
//!   pauses for user input (a custom `NeedsHuman` tool, or a gated tool under a
//!   configured `PermissionChecker`), the event loop sees
//!   `AgentEvent::NeedClarification` / `ToolApprovalRequested`, answers it via
//!   `Agent::answer`, and resumes the run via `Agent::resume_stream` — the
//!   "ask → answer → resume" flow. When the approved question was a gated tool
//!   call, resuming also RE-EXECUTES that tool for real (against the agent's
//!   own tool executor) and writes the genuine output back before the loop
//!   continues — no extra code needed, it happens automatically inside
//!   `resume`/`resume_stream` (bamboo-agent#509).
//!
//!   A separate mechanism, `AgentEvent::ChildApprovalRequested`, covers an
//!   out-of-process CHILD sub-agent's gated tool (only relevant if you've also
//!   wired the engine's actor/broker transport — `with_defaults_for_data_dir`
//!   does not). Answer those with `Agent::answer_child_approval`, not
//!   `Agent::answer`.
