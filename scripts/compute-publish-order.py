"""Print the crates.io publish order for the Bamboo workspace, one per line.

The order is derived from the REAL dependency graph (``cargo metadata``), not a
hand-maintained list. A stale hand-list is what silently dropped sub-crates
(e.g. bamboo-config, bamboo-llm) from the publish loop and broke the nightly
release: a dependency was published before the crates it needs existed on the
index. Computing the order here keeps it in lock-step with the workspace.

Scope: ``bamboo-agent``'s transitive workspace-dependency closure (the published
library and everything it pulls in), dependencies first. Since the TUI folded
into the main binary as ``bamboo tui``, that closure includes bamboo-tui and
bamboo-client-core automatically — no list to maintain. Workspace members
outside the closure are intentionally excluded.

Run from the workspace root (where the top-level Cargo.toml lives).
