# Project identity and shared resources

A Bamboo Project is a stable user-local identity shared by sessions. It is not
derived from a workspace, repository name, remote URL, or path hash. A session's
`project_id` remains unchanged when its current workspace moves between a main
checkout, linked worktree, subdirectory, or an unregistered temporary directory.

Projects live below the configured Bamboo data directory:

```text
${BAMBOO_DATA_DIR}/projects/<opaque-project-id>/
├── project.json
├── settings.json
├── skills/
├── skills-<mode>/
├── commands/
├── memory/v1/
├── artifacts/
└── state/
```

`project.json` is authoritative. `projects/index.json` is rebuildable. Project
updates use revision/ETag compare-and-swap. The opaque ID, not the display name,
is the directory component, so renaming a Project does not move its resources.
Archived Projects keep their sessions and resources.

## Project and Workspace

Every new active Project has one canonical `project_path`: the user's source
folder and the Project's default execution directory. It is distinct from
`project_home`, Bamboo's private resource directory shown above. A Project can
also register additional workspace/worktree roots. All roots own their
descendant paths. Bamboo rejects a Project path CAS update, session assignment,
or Workspace tool change when the confinement-resolved destination belongs to
another Project. An unregistered directory remains an ephemeral workspace and
is not added to the registry. For an assigned session, user-facing explicit
switches through session PATCH or chat reject an unregistered directory with
`project_workspace_unbound`; bind it through the Project workspace API first.
Unassigned sessions may continue to select unregistered directories.

Assigned sessions resolve their effective workspace with one precedence:

```text
explicit request/tool workspace
  > persisted session workspace
  > Project.project_path
```

Resolution stops there. Global `default_work_area` and session-scoped temporary
directories are compatibility fallbacks only for Unassigned/legacy sessions.
Missing, moved, non-directory, or confinement-relocated Project paths fail
closed with `project_path_missing` or `project_path_unavailable`; they never
drift to a global, foreign-Project, or temporary directory.

Resource precedence is:

```text
builtin < global/user < Project home < current Workspace < session activation
```

Workspace-local overlays remain in `<git-root>/.bamboo/`. Project skills and
commands are shared by all Project sessions; Workspace skills and commands can
override them. Deterministic workflows remain `workflow.yaml` files inside skill
bundles—there is no standalone Project `workflows/` directory.

For repository compatibility only, a Workspace may contain legacy read-only
`.bamboo/workflows/*.md` sources. An assigned Project session explicitly
migrates such a source into the Project home's canonical `skills/` layer; an
unassigned legacy session retains the bounded Workspace `.bamboo/skills/`
fallback. Migration never creates a Project-home `workflows/` directory,
never modifies the source, and records the relative `original_source` plus the
`lotus-119-complete` compatibility removal boundary in the migrated bundle.

Project memory and Dream data are stored in
`projects/<id>/memory/v1`. Assigned sessions never derive a write scope from a
workspace path.

## API and propagation

The `/api/v1/projects` API creates, lists, updates, binds, unbinds, inspects,
archives, and unarchives Projects. Create requires `project_path`; list/detail
return it; PATCH can change it without changing `project_id`. Mutations require
the current revision through `If-Match`. `POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/unarchive`
restores only an archived Project, returns its canonical manifest and new ETag,
and publishes `ProjectUpdated`. Missing or stale `If-Match` values return `428`
or `412`; restoring an already-active Project returns structured
`project_not_archived` (`409`). Restore preserves Project identity, paths,
bindings, shared resources, and session ownership. The current primary path
cannot be unbound—select a replacement with Project CAS first.
Session create/list/detail and chat contracts expose `project_id`; explicit
session reassignment also requires `If-Match` and is rejected while the session
is running.

`PATCH /api/v1/sessions/{id}` accepts `workspace_path` as an immediate durable
Workspace switch. It requires `If-Match` (`428` when absent, `412` when stale),
never changes `project_id`, updates the session metadata/index before returning,
and publishes `session_project_updated` with `project_id`, `workspace_path`, and
`metadata_version` on the account feed. Assigned sessions may select only an
existing path already bound to their active Project; the endpoint never binds
paths as a side effect. Errors are structured as `workspace_invalid` (`400`),
`project_workspace_conflict`, `project_workspace_unbound`, `project_archived`,
or `session_project_running_conflict` (`409`). Sending `project_id` and
`workspace_path` together validates and commits both as one explicit
reassignment transaction.

`POST /chat` retains its compatibility behavior where an explicitly supplied
`workspace_path` becomes the persisted Workspace for that chat turn. It uses
the same active-Project, path, ownership, and pre-existing-binding validation
as the PATCH switch, while chat requests that omit the field keep the current
durable Workspace/fallback behavior.

Child, resident, guardian, remote actor, schedule, connect, headless, TUI, and
SDK creation paths propagate the typed Project ID. Normal chat and Workspace
changes never reassign it.

The system prompt uses separate Project and Workspace marker blocks. The
Project block distinguishes `Project path` from `Project home (Bamboo data)`;
the Workspace block reports the effective path plus `explicit`, `session`, or
`project_default` source. Project identity/path remain stable while ordinary
Workspace changes replace only the Workspace block. Resource counts and
revisions are dynamic per-round context, not part of the cacheable identity
prefix. Prompt and resource APIs expose only redacted names, status, counts,
and revisions—never MCP headers, environment values, or credential secrets.

## Legacy Project assignment

Root persistence protects Project membership with the existing
`metadata_version` and `created_at`. Full and runtime writes revalidate the
small canonical `runtime.json` under the cross-process session lock. An older
revision, a changed creation time, or a different Project without exactly the
next revision returns a typed storage conflict before files or caches publish.
Project changes use checked revision increments, including removal and
reassignment; overflow returns `409 session_metadata_revision_exhausted` from
Project/Workspace PATCH. A concurrent context change caught at its final writer
returns `409 session_authority_conflict` and requires reloading before retry.

Merge-save adopts durable Project membership together with its revision and
workspace context into the caller snapshot. The SDK's first assignment of an
already persisted Unassigned Root validates the candidate without publishing a
runtime workspace, advances the revision, commits its sidecar, and only then
enters normal execution preparation. New unsaved sessions retain revision zero.
These are stale-snapshot guarantees for trusted storage writers, not an ACL for
arbitrary Rust callers that deliberately fabricate newer revisions.

A Root with missing or corrupt runtime state remains readable through the
legacy history fallback, but cannot be saved, cleared, or rebuilt by automatic
sidecar migration or Task writes. A main-only legacy Root is indistinguishable
from one that lost newer Project context. Restoring its correct canonical
runtime state is required before mutation; reconstructing authority from old
history is deliberately unavailable. Strict Root authority reads also require
main/runtime creation times to match. Legacy Child sidecar migration remains
available. No new identity registry, Project epoch or recovery journal is added.
An interrupted first create with only empty layout directories can be retried.
A full save can also complete a missing main file when the valid runtime still
proves exactly the same creation identity, Project and revision; it cannot
advance context during that repair. Runtime and Task writes require the pair.

Migration dry-runs match only exact canonical bindings or a safely resolved
common Git directory. Ambiguous names, missing paths, remote URLs, and path
hashes remain Unassigned. When a dry-run session supplies only `workspace_path`,
the server reads that existing Workspace to derive its canonical path, Git
common directory. Caller-supplied evidence remains authoritative and is never
rewritten. Missing, unreadable, or nonexistent Workspaces produce diagnostics
and no derived evidence instead of failing the request. This enrichment is
read-only and never updates a session, Project manifest, or index.

Manifest v1 migration promotes an old binding only when exactly one exists.
Zero bindings remain `needs_configuration`; multiple bindings remain
`needs_selection` and are never resolved by vector order or a `main` label.
