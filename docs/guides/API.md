# Bamboo API Documentation

Welcome to the Bamboo AI Agent API documentation. Bamboo provides a fully self-contained AI agent backend framework with built-in HTTP/HTTPS server capabilities.

## Overview

Bamboo offers RESTful API endpoints for creating and managing AI agent conversations, executing agent loops, and streaming real-time events.

## Base URL

```
http://localhost:9562/api/v1
```

## API Endpoints

### Chat Operations

#### Create Chat Message

```http
POST /api/v1/chat
```

Create a new chat session or add a message to an existing session.

Supply an optional `Idempotency-Key` header when a client may retry after an
ambiguous timeout. For 10 minutes, an equivalent retry returns the first
response without appending the message again. Reusing the key with another
payload returns `409 idempotency_key_conflict`. Receipts are process-local and
bounded; omitting the header preserves the normal behavior.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "message": "Help me write a function",
  "session_id": "optional-session-id",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
  "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant",
  "enhance_prompt": "Additional instructions",
  "workspace_path": "/path/to/workspace"
}
```

Root sessions can opt into delegation guidance with
`"root_orchestration_prompt": true` in the chat request. The choice is stored
with the session and applies to the first execution and later resumes; omitting
the field keeps the current choice, and `false` turns it off. The guidance
covers child planning, progress checks, correction, scope control, and final
evidence. Child sessions do not receive it. This prompt choice does not change
tool permissions.

Root sessions can also select `"root_orchestration_only": true`. This durable
execution mode supplies the same delegation guidance even when
`root_orchestration_prompt` is unset. It limits the Root to these nine exact
tool execution identities: `SubAgent`, `Plan`, `Task`,
`session_history_current`, `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `GetFileInfo`, and
`ViewImage`. Other tools, including shell and editing tools, are unavailable
to that Root; delegated children retain their own tool authority. The mode and
the prompt-only choice are independent.

The first chat request for a new Root may select this mode with
`root_orchestration_only`. For an **existing** Root, omit that field from
`POST /chat` and use the recoverable mode operation below. An explicit value
on an existing Root chat returns `428 root_mode_operation_required` before a
message is appended. A Child cannot select or clear the mode. The authoritative
selection is returned by `GET /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}`; clients should
read it after reload instead of treating a local choice as persisted state.

**Response:** `201 Created`

```json
{
  "session_id": "uuid-string",
  "stream_url": "/api/v1/events/session-id",
  "status": "streaming"
}
```

**Next Steps:** After creating a chat, call `POST /api/v1/execute/{session_id}` to start the agent.

---

#### Select or Recover an Existing Root Mode

`GET /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}` returns these detail-only fields for a Root:

```json
{
  "session": {
    "root_orchestration_only": false,
    "root_mode_transition_epoch": 0,
    "root_mode_birth_token": "opaque-64-character-hex-token"
  }
}
```

To change an existing Root, generate one canonical lowercase UUID and form the
operation ID as `<expected_epoch>:<uuid>`, for example
`0:550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`. Send the detail's birth token,
epoch, and desired mode to:

```http
POST /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/root-mode-operations/{operation_id}
```

```json
{
  "birth_token": "opaque-64-character-hex-token",
  "expected_epoch": 0,
  "enabled": true
}
```

A committed response is `200 OK`, with `Cache-Control: no-store`:

```json
{
  "status": "committed",
  "operation_id": "0:550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "expected_epoch": 0,
  "resulting_epoch": 1,
  "enabled_at_completion": true,
  "root_tool_authority_revision": 1
}
```

If the response is lost or times out, keep the **same** operation ID and body
and call `POST /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/root-mode-operations/{operation_id}/recover`.
Recovery returns the committed terminal receipt if selection finished first.
If recovery reaches the durable writer first, it records a terminal `fenced`
receipt and prevents a late selection from changing the mode. An ordinary
selection replay after that fence returns `409 root_mode_operation_fenced`.
If a later operation has already advanced the epoch after this receipt was
evicted, recovery returns `200` with `status: "fenced_by_successor"`,
the validated `operation_id` and `expected_epoch`, `current_epoch`,
`current_enabled`, and `root_tool_authority_revision`; the old
selection remains unable to commit.

The server retains the latest eight terminal receipts for exact retries across
process restarts. Older receipts are replaced by the durable successor epoch;
their original operation ID cannot be rebound to another epoch. Reuse of a
retained operation ID with a different `enabled` value returns
`409 root_mode_operation_conflict`. A stale epoch or changed Root birth returns
`412`; a selected Skill or Workflow, or active legacy PlanMode, gives a durable
`rejected_incompatible` terminal result (`409` on selection, `200` on
recovery). A storage backend without this operation returns `503` and makes
no mode change. Other storage or proof errors return
`503 root_mode_outcome_unconfirmed`: the commit may already have happened, so
retain the operation ID and recover it. The default Supervisor uses its
existing strict management proof when refreshing the next provider catalog.

Roots with no terminal mode operation remain readable with their legacy v1
authority proof. The first terminal operation writes a v2 proof, so an older
backend's v1-only writer fails closed rather than discarding its epoch/history.
Run current backend versions for mode operations; old processes cannot serve
that Root after this upgrade. Downgrading an authority proof is unsupported.

A successful mode response and a subsequent ordinary chat are separate
operations. Another client can change the mode between them; clients should
check session detail if the mode used by that chat matters. A running tool
batch retains its admitted catalog snapshot, while later tool boundaries
adopt durable Root authority. Legacy clients that hold an ambiguous combined
`POST /chat` marker cannot clear it with this new operation: that old POST had
no operation ID, so its terminal result cannot be proven here.

### Agent Execution

#### Execute Agent

```http
POST /api/v1/execute/{session_id}
```

Start the agent execution loop for a session.

`Idempotency-Key` has the same optional 10-minute replay contract as chat. An
equivalent retry returns the original status, body, and `run_id` without
starting another run. The canonical nested route
`POST /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/execute` shares the same receipt.

**Path Parameters:**

- `session_id` - Session identifier from `/api/v1/chat`

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6"
}
```

**Response:** `202 Accepted`

```json
{
  "session_id": "session-id",
  "status": "started",
  "events_url": "/api/v1/events/session-id"
}
```

**Note:** The `model` parameter is **required** and must be provided in every request.

---

### Event Streaming

#### Subscribe to Events (Recommended)

```http
GET /api/v1/events/{session_id}
```

Subscribe to real-time agent events via Server-Sent Events (SSE).

**Path Parameters:**

- `session_id` - Session identifier

**Response:** `200 OK` (text/event-stream)

**Event Format:**

```
data: {"type":"token","content":"Hello"}
data: {"type":"tool_start","tool_call_id":"call_1","tool_name":"Read","arguments":{"file_path":"README.md"}}
data: {"type":"tool_complete","tool_call_id":"call_1","result":{ /* ToolResult */ }}
data: {"type":"complete","usage":{"prompt_tokens":10,"completion_tokens":5,"total_tokens":15}}
```

The `type` discriminant is the snake_case form of the `AgentEvent` variant (the enum is `#[serde(tag = "type", rename_all = "snake_case")]`).

**Terminal Events:**

- `complete` - Agent finished successfully
- `cancelled` - Run cancelled by the user
- `error` - Agent encountered an error

**Example (JavaScript):**

```javascript
const eventSource = new EventSource('/api/v1/events/session-123');

eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('Event:', data);

  if (data.type === 'Complete' || data.type === 'Error') {
    eventSource.close();
  }
};
```

> **Other event transports.** Besides the per-session `GET /api/v1/events/{session_id}` feed above, there is an **account-wide, resumable** change feed `GET /api/v1/stream` (SSE) that multiplexes events across all sessions — resume with `?since=<seq>` or the `Last-Event-ID` header. There is also a **live WebSocket** transport at `/v2/stream` (per-device token auth) which is the primary transport used by the web/desktop clients; the SSE feeds remain available for simple/curl clients.

---

### Session Management

#### Copy Session

```http
POST /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/copy
```

Create an independent root session from an existing session. The copy receives
a new id and preserves the complete transcript, durable configuration,
permission mode, Project assignment, Workspace assignment, and attachments.
Attachment URLs are rewritten to the copied session id. Durable workflow
selection/activation snapshots are retained so the conversation can be
reconstructed; workflow run ids, lifecycle outbox/cache data, and other
transient execution, pending approval/question, child identity, schedule,
placement, and run-status state are not copied. Copying a child session always
produces an independent root with no parent chain.

The operation is failure-atomic: storage or attachment-copy failure leaves no
target session or index entry. Concurrent requests intentionally create
different copies.

**Response:** `201 Created` with `{ "session": SessionSummary }`, `404 Not
Found` when the source does not exist, or `500 Internal Server Error` when the
copy could not be committed.

---

#### Delete Session

```http
DELETE /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}
```

Delete a session and cancel any running execution.

**Path Parameters:**

- `session_id` - Session identifier

**Response:** `200 OK` (no body) or `404 Not Found`

**Side Effects:**

- Session removed from storage
- Session removed from memory
- Running execution cancelled

---

#### Get Session History

```http
GET /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/history
```

Retrieve message history for a session.

**Path Parameters:**

- `session_id` - Session identifier

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "session_id": "session-id",
  "messages": []
}
```

**Note:** Currently returns empty messages array. Full implementation planned.

---

### Execution Control

#### Stop Agent Execution

```http
POST /api/v1/stop/{session_id}
```

Cancel a running agent execution.

**Path Parameters:**

- `session_id` - Session identifier

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Agent execution stopped"
}
```

**Behavior:**

- Completes current LLM request
- Cancels pending tool executions
- Saves session state
- Updates status to `Cancelled`

---

### Interactive Questions

#### Get Pending Question

```http
GET /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/question
```

Check if the agent is waiting for user input.

**Path Parameters:**

- `session_id` - Session identifier

**Response (Pending Question):** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "has_pending_question": true,
  "question": "Which language should I use?",
  "options": ["TypeScript", "JavaScript", "Python"],
  "allow_custom": false,
  "tool_call_id": "call_123"
}
```

**Response (No Question):** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "has_pending_question": false
}
```

---

#### Submit User Response

```http
POST /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/respond
```

Submit a response to a pending question from a pause-capable custom tool, a
permission gate, or a compatible persisted session.

**Path Parameters:**

- `session_id` - Session identifier

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "response": "TypeScript"
}
```

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Response recorded. Agent loop will continue.",
  "response": "TypeScript"
}
```

**Validation:** If `allow_custom` is false, response must match one of the provided options.

---

### Tool Execution

#### Execute Tool Directly

```http
POST /api/v1/tools/execute
```

Execute a built-in tool without running the full agent loop.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "tool_name": "read_file",
  "parameters": [
    {"name": "path", "value": "/path/to/file"}
  ]
}
```

**Response:** `200 OK`

---

## Typical Workflow

### 1. Create a Chat Session

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9562/api/v1/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Help me write a Rust function",
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6"
  }'
```

Response includes `session_id` and `stream_url`.

### 2. Start Agent Execution

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9562/api/v1/execute/{session_id} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "claude-sonnet-4-6"}'
```

Response includes `events_url`.

### 3. Subscribe to Events

```javascript
const eventSource = new EventSource('/api/v1/events/{session_id}');
eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log(data);
  if (data.type === 'Complete' || data.type === 'Error') {
    eventSource.close();
  }
};
```

### 4. Handle Interactive Questions (Optional)

If the agent asks a question:

```bash
# Check for pending question
curl http://localhost:9562/api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/question

# Submit response
curl -X POST http://localhost:9562/api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/respond \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"response": "Use async/await"}'
```

### 5. Stop or Delete (Optional)

```bash
# Stop execution
curl -X POST http://localhost:9562/api/v1/stop/{session_id}

# Delete session
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:9562/api/v1/sessions/{session_id}
```

---

## Error Handling

All endpoints return consistent error responses:

```json
{
  "error": "Error message",
  "session_id": "session-id"  // When applicable
}
```

**Common HTTP Status Codes:**

- `200 OK` - Success
- `201 Created` - Resource created
- `202 Accepted` - Request accepted for processing
- `400 Bad Request` - Invalid request or missing parameters
- `404 Not Found` - Resource not found
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Server error

---

## Event Types

### AgentEvent Types

The `type` field is the snake_case name of the `AgentEvent` variant
(`crates/core/bamboo-agent-core/src/agent/events.rs`). The most common
streaming variants:

| `type` | Description | Fields |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| `token` | Assistant text token | `content` |
| `reasoning_token` | Reasoning/thinking token | `content` |
| `tool_token` | Live output from a running tool | `tool_call_id`, `content` |
| `tool_start` | Tool execution started | `tool_call_id`, `tool_name`, `arguments` |
| `tool_complete` | Tool finished successfully | `tool_call_id`, `result` |
| `tool_error` | Tool failed | `tool_call_id`, `error` |
| `token_budget_updated` | Token usage / budget update | `usage` |
| `complete` | Execution finished | `usage` |
| `cancelled` | Run cancelled by the user | `message` |
| `error` | Execution failed | `message` |

The enum also carries session-, task-, plan-, and sub-agent-lifecycle variants
(e.g. `tool_lifecycle`, `need_clarification`, `task_list_updated`,
`sub_agent_started`, `plan_mode_entered`, `message_appended`); consult
`events.rs` for the exhaustive list and exact field shapes.

---

## Configuration

Bamboo can be configured via command-line flags or environment variables:

```bash
bamboo serve --port 9562 --data-dir ~/.local/share/bamboo
```

**Environment Variables:**

- `BAMBOO_PORT` - Server port (default: 9562)
- `BAMBOO_DATA_DIR` - Data directory
- `BAMBOO_BIND` - Bind address (default: 127.0.0.1)
- `BAMBOO_WORKSPACE_ROOT` - Root directory for session workspaces that have no
  explicit path (default: `<data-dir>/workspaces`). A session with no
  configured/explicit workspace gets `<workspace-root>/<session-id>` instead
  of the server process's working directory.
- `BAMBOO_WORKSPACE_CONFINE` - Set to `1`/`true` to require every explicit
  workspace path to be canonicalized and confined under
  `BAMBOO_WORKSPACE_ROOT` (escapes via `..`, a symlink, or an absolute path
  elsewhere are relocated under the root instead of honored as-is). Off by
  default for local single-user use, where pointing bamboo at an existing
  project directory anywhere on disk must keep working; implicitly enabled
  when `BAMBOO_WORKSPACE_ROOT` is set explicitly. Intended for orchestrated /
  multi-tenant deployments that want "one folder = one tenant's entire state".

### Runtime Config Patching (`POST /v1/bamboo/config`)

The live `config.json` (providers, subagents, notifications, MCP servers,
bamboo-connect platforms, ...) is updated with a partial JSON PATCH — you
only send the fields you want to change. Two rules:

- **An omitted key leaves the existing value unchanged.** This is
  unconditional back-compat: a patch that doesn't mention a field never
  touches it.
- **An explicit JSON `null` deletes that field**, opt-in per value
  ([RFC 7386](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7386) JSON Merge Patch
  semantics). What "deleted" means depends on what's there:
  - an optional field (e.g. `subagents.claude_code_binary`) → cleared back
    to unset.
  - a whole object subtree (e.g. `notifications: null`) → reset to defaults.
  - one entry of a dynamic map (e.g. `provider_instances: {"<id>": null}`,
    `mcpServers: {"<name>": null}`) → that one entry removed, siblings
    untouched.
  - a whole array (e.g. `connect.platforms: null`) → emptied. A `null`
    *inside* an array element is never a delete marker — arrays are always
    replaced wholesale, not merged element-by-element.

  Secret fields (`api_key`, `token`, `device_key`, `app_secret`) treat
  `null` as an explicit clear, equivalent to sending `""` — both are
  distinct from a masked placeholder (`****...****`, which means "keep the
  existing secret").

  Choose your blast radius by choosing which level you null out: nulling a
  single leaf (`providers.openai.api_key: null`) clears just that field;
  nulling an enclosing object (`providers.openai: null`) wipes the whole
  provider's config.

See `bamboo_config::patch::deep_merge_json`'s doc comment for the full
semantics table and the precedence rules against masked-placeholder
resolution.

## Architecture

Bamboo follows a session-based architecture with unified server implementation:

1. **Session**: Contains conversation history and state
2. **Agent Loop**: Processes messages and executes tools
3. **LLM Provider**: Communicates with AI model APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Copilot)
4. **Tool Executor**: Runs built-in tools (read, write, execute, etc.)
5. **Event Broadcaster**: Streams real-time events via Server-Sent Events
6. **Unified Server**: Single HTTP server with explicit routing (~120 routes)

### Server Architecture

- **`bamboo-server` crate**: Unified HTTP server with explicit routing
- **Explicit routing**: All routes registered in `crates/bamboo-server/src/routes/`
- **Direct provider access**: No HTTP callbacks to self (eliminates proxy pattern)
- **Handler organization** (`crates/bamboo-server/src/handlers/`):
  - Core agent handlers in `handlers/agent/` (chat, execute, events, stop, history, respond, etc.)
  - Provider handlers in `handlers/` (openai/, anthropic/, gemini/, copilot_auth/, agent_api.rs)
  - Feature handlers in `handlers/` (settings/, tools/, workspace/, skill/, command/)
