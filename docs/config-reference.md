# Configuration reference

Everything Bamboo reads from `${data_dir}/config.json` (`data_dir` defaults to
`${HOME}/.bamboo`, override with `BAMBOO_DATA_DIR` or `--data-dir`), plus the
handful of sibling files and environment variables that participate in
configuration.

Prefer not to hand-edit JSON? `bamboo init` writes a starter config,
`bamboo config set <dotted.key> <value>` changes one value at a time (secret
keys are encrypted automatically — see [Secrets](#secrets-and-masking) below),
and `bamboo config [--show-secrets]` prints the resolved config. This document
is for when you need to know exactly what a key does or edit the file by hand.

**Precedence:** `config.json` < environment variables < CLI flags (`bamboo
serve --port ...` wins over everything). Provider selection specifically is
`providers.<name>` / `provider_instances.<id>` (file) → `BAMBOO_PROVIDER` /
`BAMBOO_<PROVIDER>_API_KEY` (env, in-memory only, never persisted) →
`--provider` (CLI).

Source of truth for every struct below: `crates/infra/bamboo-config/src/config.rs`
(`pub struct Config`, around line 1069) unless noted otherwise. Struct field
lists here are derived directly from that code — if the two disagree, the code
wins; please file an issue.

## Top-level shape

```json
{
  "provider": "anthropic",
  "providers": { "anthropic": { "api_key": "sk-ant-...", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6" } },
  "server": { "port": 9562, "bind": "127.0.0.1" }
}
```

Every top-level key is optional (`#[serde(default)]`) — a config with only
`provider`/`providers` is valid; every field below silently falls back to its
default. The full field list of `Config`:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `http_proxy` / `https_proxy` | `String` | Outbound proxy URLs for provider HTTP calls. |
| `proxy_auth_credential_ref` | `Option<String>` | Stable reference to isolated proxy credentials (normally `proxy.default.auth`); no proxy plaintext, ciphertext, or mask is stored in ordinary config. |
| `provider` | `String` | Default provider name. Default `"anthropic"`. |
| `defaults` | `Option<DefaultsConfig>` | Per-role model routing (`chat`/`fast`/`vision`/`planning`/...); only consulted when `features.provider_model_ref` is on. |
| `providers` | `ProviderConfigs` | Legacy single-instance-per-type provider configs. See [Providers](#providers). |
| `provider_instances` | `HashMap<String, ProviderInstanceConfig>` | Authoritative provider configs, keyed by a stable routing id (e.g. two Anthropic keys under different labels). Runtime construction, model resolution, model discovery and child-agent credential scoping read these entries directly. |
| `default_provider_instance` | `Option<String>` | Which enabled `provider_instances` entry is the default. A missing id is accepted only as a temporary hybrid reference to a real legacy provider stanza. |
| `server` | `ServerConfig` | HTTP bind/port/TLS. See [Server](#server). |
| `keyword_masking` | `KeywordMaskingConfig` | Outbound-body secret scrubbing. See [Keyword masking](#keyword-masking). |
| `anthropic_model_mapping` / `gemini_model_mapping` | `{ mappings: HashMap<String,String> }` | Alias an OpenAI-shaped model id (e.g. `"gemini-pro"`) to the real upstream model id for that provider's compat endpoint. |
| `hooks` | `HooksConfig` | Request preflight hooks; today just `image_fallback` (text-only-model image handling). |
| `tools` | `ToolsConfig` | `{ disabled: Vec<String> }` — tool names omitted from every session's schema globally. |
| `skills` | `SkillsConfig` | `{ disabled: Vec<String> }` — skill ids excluded from selection/loading globally. |
| `env_vars` | `Vec<EnvVarEntry>` | User-managed env vars injected into `Bash`-tool child processes. `secret: true` entries persist only stable `credential_ref`/`configured` metadata; their values live in the isolated credential store and are returned masked by the API. |
| `default_work_area` | `Option<DefaultWorkAreaConfig>` | `{ path: Option<String> }` — default workspace when a session has none set. |
| `access_control` | `Option<AccessControlConfig>` | Password gate for the HTTP API/UI (`password_enabled`, hashed+salted). |
| `features` | `FeatureFlags` | `{ provider_model_ref: bool, dynamic_model_routing: bool }` — incremental rollout toggles, both off by default. |
| `stream_timeout` | `StreamTimeoutConfig` | Independent transport, first-semantic, and midstream-semantic watchdog deadlines. See below. |
| `context_management` | `ContextManagementConfig` | Selects legacy summary compression or the opt-in exact-history retrieval window. See below. |
| `memory` | `Option<MemoryConfig>` | Memory/auto-dream/gardener settings. See below. |
| `subagents` | `SubagentsConfig` | Sub-agent execution + the `claude_code` executor. See below. |
| `cluster_fabric` | `ClusterFabricConfig` | Operator-managed remote nodes for deploying `broker-agent` workers over SSH; empty by default. SSH secrets encrypted at rest. |
| `mcp` (on-disk key `mcpServers`) | `McpConfig` | External tool servers. See [MCP servers](#mcp-servers). |
| `notifications` | `NotificationsConfig` | Desktop/ntfy/Bark delivery channels. See below. |
| `connect` | `ConnectConfig` | **Not actually stored here** — see [connect](#connect--the-im-bridge). |
| `plugin_trust` | `PluginTrustConfig` | Plugin install trust policy. See below. |
| `extra` | `BTreeMap<String, Value>` | Catch-all flatten for keys not (yet) promoted to a typed field — `permissions`, `externalAgents`, `subagentRouting`, setup-wizard state, etc. live here. Round-trips losslessly even for fields this version of Bamboo doesn't know about. |

Env variable writes use the dedicated revisioned `/bamboo/env-vars` API. Its
`revision` is the env-domain CAS revision stored in the credential envelope;
every semantic env change (including metadata, public values, ordering, and
deletes) advances it once, while a true no-op keeps it and emits no change
event. `config.json` participates in the same recoverable manifest transaction
and is hash-CAS protected. Secret
inputs use three states: omitted `value` keeps an existing secret, `value: ""`
explicitly clears it, and a non-empty value replaces it. Masks and client-sent
`credential_ref`/`configured`/`value_encrypted` fields are rejected. Existing
Lotus builds do not yet send this revision or omit `value` for metadata-only
edits; updating that client contract is deferred to the Lotus follow-up and is
not part of Bamboo Issue #597.

## Providers

`provider_instances` is the durable and runtime authority. The legacy
single-instance `provider` / `providers` shape remains accepted as a
serde/migration compatibility input, most importantly so older installations
can be materialized into provider instances safely on cold start:

```json
{
  "provider": "anthropic",
  "providers": {
    "anthropic": { "api_key": "sk-ant-...", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6" }
  }
}
```

Each provider stanza (`OpenAIConfig` / `AnthropicConfig` / `GeminiConfig` /
`CopilotConfig` / `BodhiConfig`, all in `config.rs`) shares this core shape —
`api_key` (write-only; persisted as `api_key_encrypted`, never re-emitted
plaintext by `GET`), `base_url` (override the upstream endpoint — self-hosted
proxies, Azure-style deployments, etc.), `model`, `fast_model`, `vision_model`,
`reasoning_effort`, `responses_only_models: Vec<String>` (force these models
onto the OpenAI Responses API path), `request_overrides` (provider-specific
per-endpoint HTTP header/body tweaks), and an `extra` flatten for
forward-compat fields. `AnthropicConfig` adds `max_tokens` and
`thinking_replay_always` (needed by some Anthropic-compatible upstreams, e.g.
GLM's `/anthropic` endpoint). `BodhiConfig` adds `target_provider` (which of
openai/anthropic/gemini the Bodhi proxy should present as). `CopilotConfig`
has no `api_key` at all — it authenticates via a cached OAuth token
(`headless_auth` for headless/CI login).

For GPT-5.6+ OpenAI Responses requests from the agent loop, Bamboo derives a
stable, session-scoped `prompt_cache_key` as a domain-separated SHA-256 hash.
The raw session identifier is never serialized into the provider request, and
non-agent requests do not receive a generated key. The key is only a cache
affinity hint that can improve routing to a matching prefix; it does not
guarantee a cache hit. `request_overrides` body patches run afterward, so an
operator may replace the generated key or remove `prompt_cache_key` entirely.

The server idempotently materializes a usable selected legacy provider into
`provider_instances` when it opens the modular configuration. Built-in provider
type names become stable instance ids (`openai`, `anthropic`, and so on), the
selected id becomes `default_provider_instance`, and provider-specific fields
such as Anthropic `max_tokens` / `thinking_replay_always`, Copilot
`headless_auth`, and Bodhi `target_provider` are retained. Existing credential
references are reused; plaintext is never copied into `providers.json`.
Migration commits use the provider-section revision and the configuration
facade's recoverable transaction protocol. Reopening an already migrated
configuration is a byte/revision no-op. If the provider or credential authority
is degraded, a legacy reconciliation is pending, or the exact base revision has
changed, migration does not overwrite that state; startup retains the readable
last-known-good/hybrid view and retries on a later safe open.

For one or more provider accounts, the canonical shape is:

```json
{
  "default_provider_instance": "work",
  "provider_instances": {
    "work": { "provider_type": "anthropic", "api_key": "sk-ant-work-...", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6" },
    "personal": { "provider_type": "anthropic", "api_key": "sk-ant-personal-...", "enabled": true }
  }
}
```

`provider_instances` entries have the same field set as the legacy stanzas
plus `provider_type` (which of the five kinds this is) and `enabled` (default
`true`). An explicit instance id always wins over a same-named legacy alias,
including when that instance is disabled or invalid; Bamboo never silently
resurrects the stale alias. A temporary hybrid may keep a legacy default id
only when a real stanza with that id still exists. Other instance-native paths
do not re-project instances into global legacy slots.

`BAMBOO_PROVIDER` may select an exact instance id. A built-in type value selects
the lexicographically first enabled instance of that type, making multi-account
startup deterministic. `BAMBOO_OPENAI_API_KEY`,
`BAMBOO_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and `BAMBOO_GEMINI_API_KEY` hydrate only instances
marked for the standard environment override; they do not recreate legacy
slots. Legacy-materialized instances keep that binding so the historical
precedence remains stable: a present environment key wins, while a migrated
credential reference remains the fallback after the variable is removed. The
persisted marker records only the binding, never the secret. An environment-only
instance with no stored fallback reports `configured: false` and
`source: "environment"` whenever the variable is absent.

Use the revisioned `GET/PUT /v1/bamboo/config/provider-settings` contract or the
provider-instance CRUD endpoints for settings, and
`POST /v1/bamboo/provider-catalog/fetch-models` for live model discovery. The
legacy `GET/POST /v1/bamboo/settings/provider` and
`POST /v1/bamboo/settings/provider/models` routes are no longer registered;
older clients receive `404` and must migrate to the canonical contracts. This
HTTP retirement does not remove the on-disk compatibility input described
above.

## Server

```json
{ "server": { "port": 9562, "bind": "127.0.0.1", "workers": 10 } }
```

`port` (default `9562`), `bind` (default `127.0.0.1`), `static_dir` (serve the
bundled frontend from a custom path), `workers` (Actix worker threads, default
`10`), `tls: Option<TlsConfig>` (`cert_file`/`key_file` PEM paths for manual
TLS termination — no ACME/auto-cert). All overridable per-invocation with
`bamboo serve --port/--bind/--workers`.

## Tools, skills, hooks

- `tools.disabled: Vec<String>` — tool names (e.g. `"Bash"`) hidden from every
  session's tool schema, globally. Compare to the SDK's per-agent
  `AgentBuilder::tools([...])`, which scopes selection to one in-process
  `Agent` instead.
- `skills.disabled: Vec<String>` — skill ids excluded from selection/loading
  globally.
- `hooks.image_fallback` — how image parts are handled when the effective
  model/path is text-only (drop, OCR-replace, etc. — see
  `ImageFallbackHookConfig`). `ViewImage` returns a base64 multimodal image by
  default; with this hook enabled in `vision` mode, Bamboo asks the configured
  vision model (or its configured fallback) for a textual description before
  the next model turn.
- `lifecycle_hooks` — config-driven command or external `.js`/`.py`/`.sh`/
  `.ps1`/`.bat` script handlers for session, prompt, tool, compaction, and
  notification events. It lives in `hooks.json`; see the
  [lifecycle hooks guide](lifecycle-hooks.md) for runtime selection, the
  security model, and the input/output contract.

## LLM stream timeouts

```json
{
  "stream_timeout": {
    "transport_idle_timeout_secs": 120,
    "first_semantic_timeout_secs": 600,
    "semantic_idle_timeout_secs": 600
  }
}
```

The three watchdogs measure different signals and apply identically to the
main response stream and auxiliary silent model calls:

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `transport_idle_timeout_secs` | `120` | Maximum time for the provider call to establish its response stream, and the maximum subsequent gap between successfully received, non-empty response-body chunks. SSE ping/lifecycle events, comment heartbeats, and partial event fragments count even when they contain no token. |
| `first_semantic_timeout_secs` | `600` | Maximum time from request dispatch to the first text, reasoning, or tool-call delta. Transport keepalives do not extend it. |
| `semantic_idle_timeout_secs` | `600` | Maximum semantic-progress gap after output starts. Transport keepalives do not extend it. |

Every value must be between `1` and `86400` seconds. Invalid persisted values
are rejected by config loading; invalid values constructed by an embedding are
replaced with the safe defaults. Timeout errors report the expired phase,
deadline, provider/model identifiers, and last transport/semantic activity,
but never include prompts or raw provider payloads. A stream timeout is not
retried after text, reasoning, or tool-call output has started, because replay
could duplicate externally visible state. A timeout before any semantic output
on the primary response stream is marked retry-safe and may use the agent
loop's existing bounded turn retry policy. Auxiliary model calls are bounded by
the same watchdogs but never replay the containing agent turn.

### OpenAI-compatible proxy heartbeats

An OpenAI-compatible proxy should establish the response stream within
`transport_idle_timeout_secs`, then either forward upstream response bytes or
emit an SSE heartbeat more frequently than that deadline. Bamboo treats any
successfully received, non-empty body chunk as transport activity before
parsing SSE, including the standard comment form `: keep-alive\n\n`. These
internal activity markers do not become model output and do not extend either
semantic deadline.

For example, CLIProxyAPI supports periodic streaming heartbeats with:

```yaml
streaming:
  keepalive-seconds: 15
```

CLIProxyAPI documents `0` (disabled) as the default. Operators using that or
another compatible proxy should choose a heartbeat interval safely below the
transport timeout. If a proxy cannot emit heartbeats during long upstream
reasoning gaps, configure `transport_idle_timeout_secs` at least as high as the
intended semantic wait instead; disabling the bounded transport watchdog is
not recommended.

## Context management

`context_management` defaults to `{"strategy":"summary"}`. Missing
configuration therefore keeps the existing model-generated conversation
summary behavior. The alternative `retrieval_window` strategy keeps exact raw
messages in the Session store, removes eligible older complete turns only from
the active provider window, and directs the model to
`session_history_current` when it needs earlier evidence.

```json
{
  "context_management": {
    "strategy": "retrieval_window",
    "retrieval_window": {
      "min_recent_user_turns": 3,
      "trigger_usage_ratio": 0.8,
      "target_usage_ratio": 0.6,
      "history_tool_required": true,
      "fallback_strategy": "none"
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `strategy` | `summary` | `summary` preserves the current summarizer path; `retrieval_window` enables exact-history archival at the ordinary pre-turn pressure boundary. |
| `retrieval_window.min_recent_user_turns` | `3` | Minimum newest complete user-anchored turns that remain active. Must be greater than zero. |
| `retrieval_window.trigger_usage_ratio` | `0.80` | Provider-prepared input ratio that starts automatic archival. |
| `retrieval_window.target_usage_ratio` | `0.60` | Post-archive target ratio. Validation requires `0.01 <= target < trigger <= 1` because the planner uses whole percentages. |
| `retrieval_window.history_tool_required` | `true` | Must remain `true` in this release. Bamboo fails before archival unless the effective callable catalog contains `session_history_current`. |
| `retrieval_window.fallback_strategy` | `none` | `none` fails closed when retrieval archival is unavailable. `summary` explicitly opts into the legacy summarizer fallback. |

Retrieval-window commits require runtime persistence and are checkpointed before
the archived state is published or a provider request is sent. The checkpoint
compares the exact pre-archive base while holding the Session write lock; a
concurrent durable transcript change performs no archive write and causes the
engine to rebase, re-account, replan, and rebuild the provider request before a
bounded retry. Selecting `retrieval_window` with `fallback_strategy: "none"`
for a Session that already has a conversation summary is rejected immediately;
start a new Session or explicitly retain summary fallback. This first runtime
slice supports automatic pre-turn archival, explicit model-requested archival
through the argument-free `archive_context` tool, and critical overflow
recovery through the same summary-free boundary. `compact_context` remains a
summary-specific control: under `retrieval_window`, it fails closed unless
`fallback_strategy: "summary"` explicitly opts into the legacy summarizer.
Manual requests that are already at or below the target are durably consumed as
no-ops so they do not loop after restart. Failed archive checkpoints remain
retryable and never publish partially archived state.
Candidate fitting projects the exact post-boundary provider request. Provider-
native reasoning/tool-search replay and prior model-context ledger bytes that
the boundary resets count toward trigger pressure, but are reclaimed once (not
misclassified as permanently fixed prompt cost) when calculating the retained
target.
The raw Session transcript remains authoritative. Memory is selective context,
not a substitute for exact history.

## Memory / auto-dream / gardener

Key `memory` (`Option<MemoryConfig>` — absent means every default below
applies). All the dream/gardener toggles default **on**; the values below are
the shipped defaults, so an empty `{}` is already reasonable:

| Field | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `background_model` | `None` | Model used for memory extraction/consolidation background work; falls back to the primary model. |
| `summary_target_ratio` | `0.20` | Desired durable conversation-summary size relative to the raw source tokens represented by it. Hierarchical reducers retain this global ratio instead of applying it again at every level. |
| `summary_safe_window_percent` | `80` | Maximum share of the summarization model's total context window used by each fully rendered map/reduce request, including requested output and the tokenizer safety margin. |
| `auto_dream_enabled` | `true` | Distill conversation stretches into candidate memories + notebook entries as the session runs. |
| `auto_dream_interval_secs` | `1800` | How often the dream pass runs. |
| `project_prompt_injection` | `true` | Inject relevant project-scoped memory into the system prompt. |
| `relevant_recall` | `true` | Retrieve relevant durable memories for the current turn. |
| `relevant_recall_rerank` | `false` | Rerank recalled memories (extra model call) before injecting. |
| `project_first_dream` | `true` | Prefer project-scoped memory on a session's first dream pass. |
| `ledger_agenda_injection` / `ledger_gardener_enabled` / `ledger_distillation_enabled` | `true` | Personal-assistant ledger subsystem toggles. |
| `ledger_gardener_interval_secs` | `21600` (6h) | Ledger gardener cadence. |
| `gardener_enabled` | `true` | Background job that splits "multi-topic blob" memories; **calls no LLM when its deterministic pre-screen finds no candidates.** |
| `gardener_interval_secs` | `86400` (daily) | Gardener cadence. |
| `gardener_volume_trigger` | `25` | Run early once this many new memories have accrued, instead of waiting for the interval. |
| `gardener_max_splits_per_run` / `gardener_min_sections` | `8` / `5` | Cost guardrails on one gardener pass. |
| `dedup_gardener_enabled` | `true` | Background near-duplicate memory merge pass. |
| `dedup_gardener_min_score` | `0.6` | Jaccard similarity threshold to merge. |
| `dedup_gardener_max_merges_per_run` | `8` | Cap per pass. |
| `memory_active_capacity` | `0` (unbounded/off) | Cap on "active" memory count before older ones archive. |
| `capacity_max_archivals_per_run` | `50` | Cap per capacity-enforcement pass. |
| `granularity_freshness_gardener_enabled` | `true` | Background staleness/granularity pass. |

Automatic conversation compression always maps bounded source chunks and then
reduces their summaries, even when the selected source would fit in one model
request. Large terminal results are reduced into bounded multipart sections;
the persisted summary keeps the single overall `summary_target_ratio` budget.

`project_prompt_injection` / `relevant_recall` / `relevant_recall_rerank` /
`project_first_dream` can also be flipped via env vars — see
[Environment variables](#environment-variables) — which is handy for a
one-off container run without touching `config.json`.

`auto_dream_enabled`/`gardener_enabled` intentionally consume model tokens
when on; turn them off (`{"memory": {"auto_dream_enabled": false}}`) for a
minimal-cost deployment.

## Sub-agents + external CLI executors

Key `subagents` (`SubagentsConfig`). Sub-agents always run as independent
actor subprocesses (crash isolation + real parallelism) — there is no
in-process runtime toggle.

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `max_concurrent` | Cap on simultaneously running sub-agents (default: 200). |
| `worker_bin` / `worker_args` | Override the sub-agent worker binary/args (defaults to the current `bamboo` binary's `subagent-worker` mode). |
| `fabric_dir` | Where the actor fabric's mailbox/state files live. |
| `executor` | Which executor spawns a child: `"echo"` (test stub) \| `"bamboo_runtime"` (default — a full nested Bamboo agent loop) \| `"claude_code"` \| `"codex"`. |
| `claude_code_binary` | Path to the `claude` binary; `None` resolves `claude` via `PATH`. |
| `claude_code_model` | `--model` passed to `claude`. |
| `claude_code_permission_mode` | `--permission-mode` passed to `claude` (always sent explicitly, even `"default"`, once this executor is selected). |
| `claude_code_inherit_user_config` | `false`/unset adds `--strict-mcp-config --setting-sources project`, sandboxing the child from your personal `claude` config. |
| `claude_code_forward_env` | Extra environment variable **names** forwarded verbatim into the child (on top of a fixed allowlist: `HOME`/`PATH`/`SHELL`/`TERM`/`LANG`/`LC_*`/`TMPDIR`/`USER`/`LOGNAME`). |
| `codex_binary` / `codex_model` | Codex executable and optional `--model` override. |
| `codex_mode` | `"exec"` (default, one process per activation) or `"app_server"` (long-lived JSON-RPC with parent approval relay). Missing app-server capability fails clearly and never downgrades. |
| `codex_auth_mode` | `"inherit"` \| `"api_key"` \| `"custom"` \| `"bamboo"`; unset defaults to the recommended `"bamboo"` parent-provider mode. |
| `codex_base_url` | Absolute HTTP(S) URL for `custom` mode only; credentials, query parameters, and fragments are rejected. |
| `codex_wire_api` | `"responses"` (the only protocol accepted by supported Codex CLI versions). |
| `codex_provider_key_ref` | Existing Bamboo provider credential reference used only by `custom` mode; the key is injected through an environment variable and is not written to the generated Codex config. |
| `codex_forward_env` | Extra environment names after `env_clear()`; `api_key` mode requires an explicit `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and other modes reject it. `CODEX_*` and Bamboo's managed provider-key variable are reserved. |
| `codex_sandbox` | Optional explicit `"read-only"` \| `"workspace-write"` \| `"danger-full-access"`. Unset derives a safe value from the child profile and live parent bypass posture. |
| `codex_approval_policy` | Exec mode accepts optional `"never"` \| `"on-failure"`; app-server mode accepts unset or `"on-request"`. Cross-mode combinations are rejected. |
| `codex_network_access` | Enables network access inside `workspace-write`; incompatible with an explicit `read-only` sandbox. |
| `codex_allow_danger_bypass` | Second gate for disabling the OS sandbox. The live parent must also be in bypass mode; root workers always downgrade and warn. |
| `remote_placements` / `schedulable_placements` | Where a sub-agent may run (local / a named Cluster Fabric node) and whether schedules may target it. |
| `mcp_role_allowlist` | Restrict which MCP servers a sub-agent role may see. |

```json
{
  "subagents": {
    "executor": "claude_code",
    "claude_code_model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    "claude_code_permission_mode": "acceptEdits",
    "claude_code_forward_env": ["MY_TOOL_TOKEN"]
  }
}
```

The same `claude_code_*` and `codex_*` field sets are duplicated per-agent under
`ExternalAgentProfile` (`Config.extra["externalAgents"]`,
`bamboo-engine/src/external_agents/config.rs`) when you need different
external CLI executor settings for different named agents rather than one
global default.

The concrete spawn implementation is `src/claude_code_executor.rs`
(`ClaudeCodeExecutor`): it runs `claude --output-format stream-json
--input-format stream-json --permission-prompt-tool stdio
--replay-user-messages --verbose [--model ...] [--permission-mode ...]
[--resume <id>]`, in a fully `env_clear()`'d child process (only the allowlist
above is passed through) — the session id maps to `claude`'s own `--resume`
via a small `claude-code-session.json` state file per sub-agent workspace.

For Codex configuration, billing implications, isolation details, and the
per-run Bamboo token contract, see [`codex-executor.md`](codex-executor.md).
Lotus validates this section with `POST /bamboo/config/validate`; its binary
Detect action calls `POST /bamboo/config/codex/detect`, which returns the
resolved `path` and `version` only after the same preflight used at worker
spawn.

## MCP servers

On-disk key `mcpServers` (legacy `mcp` alias still read), typed field
`Config.mcp: McpConfig`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "version": 1,
    "servers": [
      {
        "id": "filesystem",
        "name": "Local filesystem",
        "enabled": true,
        "transport": {
          "type": "stdio",
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allow"]
        },
        "request_timeout_ms": 60000,
        "healthcheck_interval_ms": 30000,
        "allowed_tools": [],
        "denied_tools": []
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`transport` is one of three shapes (tagged by `type`): `stdio`
(`command`/`args`/`cwd`/`env`/`startup_timeout_ms` — spawns a child process),
`sse` (`url`/`headers`/`connect_timeout_ms`), or `streamable_http` (same shape
as `sse`, MCP's newer single-endpoint transport). `reconnect` controls
auto-reconnect backoff (`enabled`, `initial_backoff_ms`, `max_backoff_ms`,
`max_attempts`, 0 = unlimited). `allowed_tools`/`denied_tools` filter which of
the server's advertised tools are actually exposed (empty `allowed_tools` =
all allowed). See the [`bamboo mcp` CLI verbs](../README.md#other-subcommands)
for managing this without hand-editing JSON, or
[`examples/mcp_client.rs`](../examples/mcp_client.rs) for wiring a server
programmatically via the SDK.

## Notifications

Key `notifications` (`NotificationsConfig`):

```json
{
  "notifications": {
    "desktop": { "enabled": true },
    "ntfy": { "enabled": true, "base_url": "https://ntfy.sh", "topic": "my-bamboo-alerts", "credential_ref": "notification.ntfy.token", "configured": true },
    "bark": { "enabled": false, "base_url": "https://api.day.app", "credential_ref": "notification.bark.device_key", "configured": false }
  }
}
```

`desktop.enabled: Option<bool>` — `None` auto-detects (on for a standalone
`bamboo serve`, off when running under a `--parent-pid` sidecar, since the
host app usually owns notifications there). `ntfy`/`bark` are push-relay
channels; `ntfy.token`/`bark.device_key` live only in the isolated encrypted
credential store. Ordinary `config.json` and parseable rotated backups contain
only stable `credential_ref`/`configured` metadata, never plaintext,
ciphertext, or a UI mask. Legacy plaintext/ciphertext is migrated idempotently
through the recoverable config/credential manifest.

`GET /bamboo/config/notifications` returns the current credential revision,
health, source, channel metadata, and per-channel configured/source/update
status without a secret slot. Notification updates use `POST /bamboo/config`
with only `expected_revision` and `notifications` in the request. Omitting a
secret keeps it, `null` or `""` clears it, and a non-empty string replaces it;
masks and client-supplied `credential_ref`/`configured`/ciphertext are rejected.
Notification changes cannot be combined with another root domain in one call.
`"notifications": null` is an explicit domain reset: both credentials are
cleared and notification metadata returns to defaults in the same transaction.
`bamboo config set notifications.ntfy.token ...` and the Bark equivalent route
through the same manifest transaction.

All three channels feed the same
`AgentEvent::Notification` category/priority policy — see
`crates/infra/bamboo-notification`.

## `connect` — the IM bridge

Drives sessions from IM platforms (Telegram, Feishu/Lark). **Despite `Config`
having a typed `connect` field, this is NOT stored in `config.json`** — it
lives in its own sibling file, `${data_dir}/connect.json`, loaded/merged by
`Config::merge_connect_config` and saved by `Config::save_connect_config`
(both in `config.rs`). A `config.json` with no `connect.json` next to it and
no legacy inline `connect` key starts **zero** background tasks — fully inert
by default.

```json
{
  "platforms": [
    {
      "id": "b3f5...",
      "type": "telegram",
      "token": "123456:ABC-DEF...",
      "allow_from": ["123456789"],
      "admin_from": []
    }
  ]
}
```

Fields (`ConnectPlatformConfig`): `id` (stable UUID, auto-backfilled on save —
never assume it's present on a hand-written entry), `type` (`"telegram"` \|
`"feishu"`; unrecognized values are skipped with a startup warning, not a hard
failure), `token`/`token_encrypted` (bot token, Telegram), `app_id` (Feishu,
not a secret), `app_secret`/`app_secret_encrypted` (Feishu), `domain` (Feishu
only — `None`/`"feishu"` → `open.feishu.cn`, `"lark"` → `open.larksuite.com`,
or an explicit `https://` base for self-hosted deployments), `allow_from`
(**empty = deny-all** — deliberately stricter default than other allowlists in
this codebase, since IM bridges are internet-facing by nature), `admin_from`
(parsed, currently unused).

A legacy inline `connect` key found inside `config.json` (from before this was
split out) is migrated automatically on next load: adopted into
`connect.json`, then stripped from `config.json`. A corrupt `connect.json` is
quarantined to `connect.json.bak` and treated as empty (fail-safe — never
silently falls back to a stale inline copy).

## `plugin_trust`

Key `plugin_trust` (`PluginTrustConfig`) — the trust policy for `bamboo
plugin install <url>` (see [Plugins how-to](guides/PLUGINS.md)):

```json
{
  "plugin_trust": {
    "trusted_hosts": ["github.com/bigduu/"],
    "trusted_keys": [
      { "label": "nova official", "algorithm": "ed25519", "public_key": "<hex>" }
    ],
    "enforcement": "strict"
  }
}
```

`trusted_hosts` — host+path prefixes a `url`-source install's URL must match
to skip `--allow-untrusted-host`. `trusted_keys` — ed25519 public keys (hex)
trusted to sign plugin bundles (defaults ship the official nova + magpie
keys); a bundle signed by one of these skips `--allow-unsigned` AND, per the
trust model, also satisfies the checksum requirement (a verified signature is
strictly stronger than a pasted `sha256`). `enforcement` — `"strict"`
(default) or `"off"` (accepts a bool too: `true`==strict, `false`==off);
`"off"` is the config-level equivalent of passing `--insecure` to every `url`
install, for a private/dev instance that never wants confirmation prompts.
Local (`local_dir`/`local_archive`) installs are never subject to this policy
— it only gates network downloads.

## Keyword masking

Key `keyword_masking` (`KeywordMaskingConfig { entries: Vec<KeywordEntry> }`,
each `{ pattern, match_type: "exact" | "regex", enabled }`). Applied as a
value-aware scan over the FINAL serialized outbound provider request body
(not field-by-field) — every string value matching a pattern is masked before
the request leaves the process, catching secrets that end up embedded in tool
output, file contents, etc., not just ones typed directly into chat.

## Permissions

Lives under the `"permissions"` key inside `Config.extra` (the flatten
catch-all — not yet promoted to a typed top-level field). Shape
(`SerializablePermissionConfig`, `crates/infra/bamboo-permission/src/config.rs`):
`whitelist: Vec<PermissionRule>`, `enabled: bool`, `session_grant_duration_secs`
(default `1800`), `mode: Option<PermissionMode>`, `confirm_threshold:
Option<RiskLevel>`, `ask_rules: Vec<String>` — glob-ish patterns like
`"Bash(rm -rf *)"` that force a confirmation prompt even under the legacy
`bypassPermissions` mode. The design invariant: bypass skips ordinary prompts
but still asks for the user's own `ask_rules` and a small hard-coded set of
catastrophic commands (`sudo`, `curl | sh`, `dd`, `rm -rf /`, …). The stronger
`auto` mode emits no approval prompt, including for those forced-ask cases, but
still enforces explicit policy and platform denials.

## Model limits (`model_limits.json`)

A separate file, `${data_dir}/model_limits.json` — user-supplied
context/output token limit overrides. Explicit user matches take precedence
over provider runtime metadata. The legacy standalone representation is a raw
array:

```json
[
  { "model_pattern": "my-custom-model", "max_context_tokens": 136192, "max_output_tokens": 8192 }
]
```

`model_pattern` is either an exact model id or a literal substring of the
runtime model id; `*` and other glob characters have no special meaning.
Among substring matches, the longest pattern wins.

`max_context_tokens` is the provider's **total input + output context
window**, not its input allowance alone. Bamboo derives the per-request input
limit as:

```text
max_request_input_tokens =
    max_context_tokens - max_output_tokens - safety_margin
```

`safety_margin` is optional. When `max_output_tokens` is omitted, Bamboo
derives it from the context window. Provider metadata that exposes separate
`max_input_tokens` and `max_output_tokens` is normalized to the same total
context-window contract before runtime budgeting.

The modular configuration store persists this section in a revisioned
`{schema_version, revision, data}` envelope. Runtime loading accepts both that
envelope and the legacy raw array, and root sessions re-read the sidecar at
the start of every agent round; an explicit session/child or engine-level
`TokenBudget` remains an intentional higher-priority override. Manage the
section through Bamboo's settings API instead of hand-editing it while the
server is running.

With no matching user or provider value, Bamboo falls back to a global default
of 1M total context / 32K per-request output allowance. There is deliberately **no built-in
per-model table**, so stale hard-coded model names cannot override live
provider metadata.

## Schedules (`schedules.json`)

Also a separate file, `${data_dir}/schedules.json` (not part of
`config.json`) — timed/cron tasks managed by `bamboo schedules
list|show|create|delete|run|runs` or the `/bamboo/schedules` HTTP routes. Each
entry (`ScheduleSpec`) has an `id`/`name`/`enabled`, a `trigger` (`Interval`
\| `Once` \| `Daily` \| `Weekly` \| `Monthly` \| `Cron`), an optional
`timezone`, `start_at`/`end_at` bounds, a `misfire_policy` (what happens if
the process was down when a fire was due: `RunOnce` (default) \| `Skip` \|
`CatchUpAll` \| `CatchUpWindow`), an `overlap_policy` (`Allow` \| `Skip` \|
`QueueOne`, default `QueueOne`), and `run_config` (the prompt/session
parameters for the fired run). Not meant for hand-editing — use the CLI/HTTP
verbs, which validate the trigger shape.

## Environment variables

Every `BAMBOO_*` variable Bamboo reads, grouped by what it affects. All are
optional; file config plus built-in defaults cover a fresh install.

**Bootstrapping / core:**

| Var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `BAMBOO_DATA_DIR` | Data directory (default `${HOME}/.bamboo`). |
| `BAMBOO_PORT` | Server port override. |
| `BAMBOO_BIND` | Server bind address override. |
| `BAMBOO_PROVIDER` | Default provider override. |
| `BAMBOO_HEADLESS` | Enable headless auth mode. |
| `BAMBOO_WORKERS` | Actix worker-count override (CLI-level). |

**Provider API keys** (in-memory only — never persisted to `config.json`,
even after `bamboo config set`; the point is a plaintext-key-free config file
for Docker/CI/secret-manager deploys):

`BAMBOO_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `BAMBOO_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `BAMBOO_GEMINI_API_KEY`.

**Memory toggles** (override the matching `memory.*` config field):
`BAMBOO_MEMORY_PROJECT_PROMPT_INJECTION`, `BAMBOO_MEMORY_RELEVANT_RECALL`,
`BAMBOO_MEMORY_RELEVANT_RECALL_RERANK`, `BAMBOO_MEMORY_PROJECT_FIRST_DREAM`.

**Server hardening / networking:**

| Var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `BAMBOO_RATE_LIMIT_PER_SECOND` / `BAMBOO_RATE_LIMIT_BURST` | Governor rate-limiter tuning. |
| `BAMBOO_RATE_LIMIT_TRUST_XFF` / `BAMBOO_RATE_LIMIT_TRUSTED_HOPS` | Trust `X-Forwarded-For` behind N reverse-proxy hops. |
| `BAMBOO_CSP` | Full Content-Security-Policy header override. |
| `BAMBOO_CSP_CONNECT_SRC` | Just the CSP `connect-src` directive. |
| `BAMBOO_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` | CORS allowlist. |
| `BAMBOO_ENABLE_DEV_ENDPOINTS` | Gate dev-only HTTP endpoints. |
| `BAMBOO_WS_AUTH_DEADLINE_MS` | WS v2 auth handshake timeout. |

**Workspace / paths:**

| Var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `BAMBOO_WORKSPACE_DIR` | Project/workspace directory override. |
| `BAMBOO_WORKSPACE_ROOT` | Root dir for session workspaces (default `{data_dir}/workspaces`). |
| `BAMBOO_WORKSPACE_CONFINE` | `1`/`true`/`yes` forces workspace paths to stay under `BAMBOO_WORKSPACE_ROOT`; implied when that var is set. |
| `BAMBOO_SKILL_MODE` | Active skill mode override. |

**Provider/runtime tuning:**

| Var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `BAMBOO_LLM_MAX_RETRIES` / `BAMBOO_LLM_RETRY_BASE_DELAY_MS` / `BAMBOO_LLM_RETRY_MAX_DELAY_MS` | LLM HTTP request retry policy. |
| `BAMBOO_RESPONSES_DEBUG` / `BAMBOO_RESPONSES_DEBUG_FILE` | Dump raw OpenAI Responses API traffic to a file for debugging. |
| `BAMBOO_PYTHON` | Python interpreter override. |

**Windows-specific:** `BAMBOO_WINDOWS_BASH_PATH`, `BAMBOO_WINDOWS_CMD_TRACE`
(also honors `BODHI_WINDOWS_CMD_TRACE`).

**Secrets / plugins / broker:**

| Var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `BAMBOO_CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Master AES-256 key for at-rest secret encryption — see [Encryption at rest](#encryption-at-rest). |
| `BAMBOO_BROKER_TOKEN` | Auth token for `bamboo broker`/`broker-agent` subcommands. |
| `BAMBOO_PLUGIN_SERVICE_CONFIG` | Config path passed into a plugin service's own subprocess. |
| `BAMBOO_FRONTEND_PACKAGE` | Override the bundled frontend static package path. |

Everything above is read via plain `std::env::var`, so it can also be set
through your process manager / Docker Compose / systemd unit rather than
exported in a shell.

## Secrets and masking

Every secret field (`providers.*.api_key`, `provider_instances.*.api_key`,
`notifications.ntfy.token`, `notifications.bark.device_key`,
`connect.platforms[].token`/`.app_secret`, `subagents.broker.token`,
`cluster_fabric` node SSH credentials, secret `env_vars` entries) follows one
contract everywhere it's read or written:

- **Read (`GET`/`bamboo config`):** a configured secret is never echoed back
  plaintext. It's replaced with exactly the literal string `****...****`; if
  the field isn't configured at all, the key is omitted entirely (not sent as
  `""`).
- **Write (`PATCH`/`bamboo config set`):** a submitted value counts as **"keep
  the existing secret unchanged"** if and only if, after trimming, it consists
  **entirely of `*` and/or `.` characters** — i.e. it matches the masked
  placeholder shape exactly. This is a whole-value check, not a substring
  check: `is_masked_api_key()` in `crates/infra/bamboo-config/src/patch.rs`.
  An **empty string** explicitly clears the secret. Anything else — including
  a string that still starts with the placeholder because a UI's prefill
  wasn't fully cleared before pasting (e.g. `****...****sk-newkey123`) — is
  treated as a **real new secret** and applied.

  This whole-value rule is deliberate: an earlier substring-based check (fixed
  as issue #430) could silently discard a user's pasted key when the
  placeholder wasn't fully selected/overwritten first. Any client embedding
  Bamboo's settings UI must never pre-fill an editable secret field with the
  masked placeholder — leave it blank to mean "keep."

## Encryption at rest

Every `*_encrypted` field uses AES-256-GCM (`crates/infra/bamboo-config/src/encryption.rs`);
on disk the ciphertext is stored as `hex(nonce):hex(ciphertext)`, a fresh
random nonce per encryption. The master key is resolved once per process, in
priority order:

1. **`BAMBOO_CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY`** — hex-encoded, must decode to exactly 32
   bytes. Highest priority; use this for reproducible/ephemeral deployments
   (containers, CI) where you manage the key externally.
2. **Key file** `${data_dir}/.bamboo_encryption_key` — hex-encoded 32 bytes,
   written with `0600` permissions atomically on Unix.
3. **Machine-derived key** — SHA-256 of a machine identifier (`/etc/machine-id`
   on Linux, registry `MachineGuid` on Windows, `ioreg IOPlatformUUID` on
   macOS) with domain separation, then **persisted to the key file** so
   subsequent runs don't re-derive it.
4. **Last resort** — cryptographically random 32 bytes, persisted to the key
   file.

**Backup/disaster-recovery implication:** losing the key file on a host with
no stable machine identifier (and no `BAMBOO_CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY` set) makes
every `*_encrypted` field in that data directory permanently undecryptable —
back up `.bamboo_encryption_key` alongside `config.json` if you back up your
Bamboo data directory at all.

## Corrupt-config recovery

If `${data_dir}/config.json` exists but fails to parse, `Config::from_data_dir`
does not crash or silently reset to defaults — it runs a recovery flow
(issue #493 and predecessors), roughly:

1. **Quarantine** the unparseable original by *copying* it to
   `config.json.corrupted.<timestamp>` (the corrupt file is never deleted or
   moved — the original stays at `config.json` untouched).
2. **Recover**, trying strategies in order:
   - **Salvage** — parse the corrupt file as generic JSON and adopt each
     top-level key individually onto the best available baseline, keeping a
     key only if the whole `Config` still deserializes with it applied.
   - **Backup** — if salvage found nothing usable, fall back to
     `config.json.bak`, `.bak.1`, `.bak.2` (newest first; 3 generations are
     kept, rotated on every successful save).
   - **Defaults** — if neither works, a fresh default `Config`.
3. The recovered config is tagged in memory (`recovery_status`, never
   persisted) with which strategy produced it and which fields were salvaged.
4. **The recovered config is never auto-saved.** `Config::save_to_dir` refuses
   to write while recovery is unconfirmed, so the quarantined corrupt original
   on disk is preserved until something explicitly calls
   `Config::confirm_recovery()` / `confirm_recovery_and_save_to_dir()` (the
   settings UI/CLI does this after showing the user what was recovered).

Net effect: a corrupted `config.json` never causes silent data loss — you
always get either your own values back (salvage/backup) or an explicit,
confirmable prompt before anything is overwritten.
