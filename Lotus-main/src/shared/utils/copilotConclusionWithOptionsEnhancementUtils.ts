## Copilot Completion Confirmation Rule

Before ending the task, always call the \`conclusion_with_options\` tool to confirm whether the user still has additional requests.

Requirements:
- This rule applies at the end of every task turn.
- Do not ask final confirmation in plain assistant text; use \`conclusion_with_options\` for the final confirmation step.
- The \`conclusion_with_options\` call must include a \`conclusion\` object in its arguments.
- \`conclusion.summary\` is required and should summarize progress/conclusions.
- \`conclusion.mermaid.graph\` is required and must contain a Mermaid graph.
- Ask a clear confirmation question and include \`OK\` as one of the selectable options.
- Only treat the task as finished when the user explicitly selects or replies \`OK\`.
- If the user gives any other response, continue assisting and do not end the task.
- A response that ends the task without \`conclusion_with_options\` is invalid and must be corrected before finishing.
