## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.95 or later
- Cargo
- Git

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Fork and clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bamboo.git
   cd bamboo
   ```

2. Create a branch from the integration branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull --ff-only
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

5. Run the server:
   ```bash
   cargo run -- serve
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Verify the complete workspace on the minimum supported Rust version
cargo +1.95.0 check --locked --workspace --all-targets --all-features

# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific test suite
cargo test --test server_integration

# Run tests with verbose output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run specific test
cargo test test_bamboo_config_default
```

### Code Style

We follow standard Rust conventions:

- Use `cargo fmt` to format your code
- Use `cargo clippy` to catch common mistakes
- Write documentation comments for public APIs
- Follow the [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/)

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - 🎨 `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
  - 🐎 `:racehorse:` when improving performance
  - 🚱 `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
  - 📝 `:memo:` when writing docs
  - 🐛 `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  - 🔥 `:fire:` when removing code or files
  - 💚 `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
  - ✅ `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
  - 🔒 `:lock:` when dealing with security
  - ⬆️ `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
  - ⬇️ `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies

### Project Structure

Bamboo uses a Cargo workspace with the following crates under `crates/`:

```
bamboo/
├── src/                    # Main crate (bamboo-agent root)
│   └── bin/bamboo.rs       # CLI binary entry point
├── crates/
│   ├── bamboo-agent-core/  # Agent runtime core, composition, storage, tools
│   ├── bamboo-compression/ # Context compression and summarization
│   ├── bamboo-domain/      # Domain types: sessions, tools, workflows, schedules, MCP
│   ├── bamboo-engine/      # Agent engine: MCP, metrics, runtime, skills
│   ├── bamboo-infrastructure/ # Config, LLM providers, process management, storage
│   ├── bamboo-memory/      # Memory system: durable memory, budget, Dream notebook
│   ├── bamboo-server/      # HTTP server, handlers, routes, app state
│   └── bamboo-tools/       # Tool registry, executor, orchestrator, built-in tools
├── tests/                  # Integration tests
├── Cargo.toml              # Workspace manifest
└── README.md
```

### Workspace Crate Responsibilities

| Crate | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `bamboo-agent-core` | Agent system composition, workspace state, core agent types |
| `bamboo-compression` | Context compression, summarization, token limits |
| `bamboo-domain` | Domain types for sessions, tools, workflows, schedules, MCP config |
| `bamboo-engine` | Agent engine: MCP integration, metrics, runtime, skill execution |
| `bamboo-infrastructure` | Configuration management, LLM providers, process management, SQLite storage |
| `bamboo-memory` | Memory system, token budget management, Dream notebook |
| `bamboo-server` | HTTP server, request handlers, routes, session app state |
| `bamboo-tools` | Tool registry, executor, orchestrator, built-in tools, permission system |

### Module Guidelines

- Each module should have a clear responsibility
- Use `mod.rs` to re-export public APIs
- Document all public items
- Include unit tests within modules
- Keep module dependencies minimal

### Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PRs
- Use descriptive test names
- Include edge cases in tests
- Use `#[tokio::test]` for async tests
- Use `tempfile` for tests that need file system access
- On macOS, use `scripts/run-macos-server-lib-tests.sh` for the monolithic
  `bamboo-server` lib-test. The library package's directly linked test/example
  artifacts disable Apple's compact-unwind table because the crate's DWARF
  unwind records exceed that format's 16 MiB offset limit. DWARF unwinding and
  line tables remain enabled for panic backtraces and debugging. The flag has
  no final-link effect while creating the rlib and is not propagated to
  downstream dev/release binaries.

### Documentation Guidelines

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Update API documentation with `///` comments
- Include examples in documentation
- Keep CHANGELOG.md updated
- Add inline comments for complex logic

## Release Process

1. Update CHANGELOG.md with new version
2. Update version in Cargo.toml
3. Create a git tag: `git tag v0.x.0`
4. Push tag: `git push origin v0.x.0`
5. CI will automatically publish to crates.io

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `enhancement` - New feature or request
- `documentation` - Improvements or additions to documentation
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention is needed
- `wontfix` - This will not be worked on

## CI/CD Setup

### Existing Workflows

Bamboo uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and publishing:

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) -- Pull requests into `dev` run locked Rust build/test, formatting, and CI workflow policy checks in the required `Test` gate. Pull requests into `main`, pushes to `main`, and manual dispatches retain comprehensive validation, with the all-feature library and integration suite in the required `E2E Tests` job. Only promotion pull requests from this repository's `dev` branch into `main` add release builds on Linux, macOS, and Windows; manual dispatches also run that platform matrix. Linux TLS and frontend contract tests run in `Test`, while macOS and Windows run their platform-specific checks. Successful dev PR builds can reuse their own Rust cache until closure; `.github/workflows/pr-cache-cleanup.yml` then removes only that same-repository PR's merge-ref caches.
- **CodeQL** (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`) -- Runs the Actions, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and Rust analyses for pull requests into `main`, pushes to `main`, and explicit manual dispatches. Routine `dev` activity does not run CodeQL.
- **Publish Crate** (`.github/workflows/publish-crate.yml`) -- Publishes the workspace crates to crates.io in dependency order. Normally dispatched by the Zenith release train with the unified date version and the `@bigduu/lotus` frontend version to embed; supports `dry_run`.
- **Publish Docker image** (`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`) -- Builds the multi-arch container image and pushes it to GHCR.
- **Documentation** (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`) -- Builds documentation on every push to main. Deploys to GitHub Pages.

### Badge URLs

After workflows run, badges resolve to:

- CI: `https://github.com/bigduu/Bamboo-agent/actions/workflows/ci.yml`
- Documentation: `https://github.com/bigduu/Bamboo-agent/actions/workflows/docs.yml`
- GitHub Pages: `https://bigduu.github.io/Bamboo-agent/`
- docs.rs: `https://docs.rs/bamboo-agent` (built automatically after publishing to crates.io)

### Setup Checklist

1. Push changes to GitHub to trigger CI.
2. Enable GitHub Pages: **Settings > Pages > Source** set to **GitHub Actions**.
3. Add `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` secret under **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions** for crates.io publishing.
4. Verify badge status in README after pushing.

## E2E Testing

```bash
# Run all e2e tests
cargo test --test e2e

# Run specific test
cargo test --test e2e test_health_endpoint
```

Tests cover all API endpoints (chat, execute, events, sessions, tasks, respond, metrics, MCP, health). Each test is isolated using actix-web's in-memory test framework.

### Adding E2E tests

1. Create `tests/e2e/new_endpoint.rs`
2. Use `create_test_app()` helper from `common`
3. Add the module to `tests/e2e/mod.rs`
