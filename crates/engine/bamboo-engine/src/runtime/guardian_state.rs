//! Durable per-session guardian-review state for the adversarial completion gate.
//!
//! The guardian feature is a sibling of the goal loop ([`crate::runtime::goal_state`]):
//! when the main agent would otherwise complete the run, the runtime can spawn a
//! read-only **guardian child** to adversarially review the final diff against
//! the active task's completion criteria before the run is allowed to stop. This
//! module owns the durable record that ties a single review pass together.
//!
//! Like `goal_state`, it lives in `session.metadata` under
//! [`GUARDIAN_STATE_METADATA_KEY`] as a single JSON value (the established
//! Bamboo pattern for structured, session-scoped state), so it round-trips
//! through the normal session save/load path with no new storage entity.
//!
//! The review budget mirrors the goal loop's `continuation_count`: a count-based
//! cap ([`GuardianState::review_count`] checked against a configured max via
//! [`GuardianState::budget_exhausted`]) so a pathological review → fix → review
//! cycle cannot run unbounded. The cap value itself lives with the caller (the
//! terminal gate), mirroring how `continuation_count` is enforced in `gold.rs`
//! rather than in `goal_state.rs`.

- Read the named changed files and the surrounding code with the dedicated read/search tools to judge correctness.
- Inspect the implementer's exact test/build evidence. Do not invoke Bash, shells, builds, tests, package managers, repository programs, or executable helpers: ambient command resolution is not a hard read-only boundary. If required evidence is absent or insufficient, reject with the exact verification still needed.
