//! Replayable session-event publishing infrastructure.
//!
//! This module owns the canonical [`AgentSessionContext`] path for publishing
//! UI-replayable session events. Every replayable event must go through an
//! atomic publisher — this helper, the runtime child-event publisher, or an
//! event forwarder — so that:
//!
//! 1. The event is cached on the session's runner for late-subscriber replay
//!    *before* any subscriber sees it on the live broadcast channel.
//! 2. The cache-then-broadcast ordering is uniform across all writers, so
//!    reconnecting clients can never miss an event that earlier subscribers
//!    received.
//!
//! ## Invariant
//!
//! No code in the workspace may pair `runner.push_critical_event` with
//! `sender.send` outside this helper, the runtime
//! `ReplayableSessionEventPublisher`, the generic engine event forwarder, or
//! the server's `spawn_event_forwarder`
//! (in `handlers::agent::execute::runtime::events`).
//! Hand-rolling the pair has historically led to inverted ordering (broadcast
//! first, cache second), which leaves a small window where a late subscriber
//! receives the live event but the cache is still empty.
//!
//! ## When to use this helper
//!
//! Use this helper for **synchronous** writers that hold an
//! [`AgentSessionContext`] directly — e.g. HTTP handlers (`patch_session`,
//! `regenerate_title`) and background tasks (`title_gen`). The runtime
//! forwarder (`spawn_event_forwarder`) handles the equivalent ordering for
//! events that flow through the engine's mpsc channel.

/// Publishes a replayable session event with the correct cache-then-broadcast
/// ordering. See module docs for the invariant.
///
/// Order is fixed and **must not** be changed:
///
/// 1. `runner.push_critical_event(event.clone())` — populate the late-subscriber
///    replay cache while the event is still un-broadcast.
/// 2. `sender.send(event)` — broadcast to all live subscribers before releasing
///    the runner lock that guards subscription snapshots.
///
/// If no runner exists for `session_id` (the session has not started yet, or
/// has already terminated), the cache step is silently skipped and the event
/// is still broadcast. This matches the semantics of the runtime forwarder.
