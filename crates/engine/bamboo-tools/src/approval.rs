//! Cross-process approval proxy (Phase 2: child → parent approval delegation).
//!
//! When a tool's permission check returns [`ConfirmationRequired`], the executor
//! normally either pauses an interactive session (synthesizing an
//! `awaiting_permission_approval` result that the engine turns into a
//! clarification) or — with no event sink — fails closed.
//!
//! A **subagent worker** runs out-of-process and cannot surface a prompt to the
//! human itself. Instead it installs an [`ApprovalProxy`] for the duration of a
//! child run (task-local, so concurrent runs on a shared worker can't see each
//! other's proxy). When a gated tool hits `ConfirmationRequired`, the executor
//! forwards the decision to the worker's parent ("host") over the
//! `bamboo-subagent` WebSocket protocol and blocks *inline* for the reply —
//! approve lets the tool proceed, deny fails it closed. No suspend/resume is
//! involved: the tool's future simply parks on the host round-trip.
//!
//! The proxy is **unset on every non-worker path**, so default behavior
//! (interactive pause / fail-closed) is byte-for-byte unchanged.
//!
//! [`ConfirmationRequired`]: crate::permission::PermissionError::ConfirmationRequired
