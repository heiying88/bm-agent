//! Runtime types for the (rewritten) [`Tool`](crate::tools::Tool) trait: the
//! per-call [`ToolOutcome`], the scheduling/gating [`ToolClass`], the owned
//! [`ToolCtx`], and the detached-work ([`RunningHandle`]) + async-completion
//! machinery. See `zenith/docs/tool-v2.md`.
//!
//! A tool declares its **per-call disposition as its return value**
//! ([`ToolOutcome`]) instead of the loop inferring async/interactive intent after
//! the fact by sniffing string markers on a plain `ToolResult`. Sync / detached /
//! interactive are the three [`ToolOutcome`] variants, decided per call; a slow
//! [`ToolOutcome::Completed`] can be runtime-promoted to [`ToolOutcome::Running`].
