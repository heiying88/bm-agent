///
/// The orchestrator's MCP host exposes powerful, host-bound tools (screen
/// capture, local credentials, …). Without scoping, *every* worker — regardless
/// of role — gets the orchestrator's entire MCP tool set in both its advertised
/// manifest and as a callable surface, so a hallucinating worker could invoke a
/// tool its role has no business touching. This policy lets the deployer restrict
/// each role to an explicit set of tools.
///
/// Resolution for a requesting worker's role (`AgentRef.role`):
/// - **Role with an explicit allowlist** → only the intersection of that
///   allowlist with the backend's tools is exposed; a `Call` for a tool not on
///   the allowlist is rejected (defense in depth — the manifest already hides it,
///   but a worker could still try to call it directly).
/// - **Role with no entry, or a request with no role** → all tools are exposed
///   (backward compatible). An empty/default allowlist therefore restricts
///   nothing, preserving the behavior of existing unrestricted workers.
///
/// The default is **allow-all for unlisted roles** (not deny-by-default) so that
/// dropping this feature in does not silently strip tools from already-deployed
/// workers; the issue (#54) asks for restricted roles to be filtered while
/// default/unrestricted roles keep all tools. Restrictions are therefore opt-in
/// and explicit per role.
///
/// # Trust boundary: the role is SELF-ASSERTED, not authenticated
///
/// `serve_mcp_proxy` resolves the requesting role from `msg.from.role` — the
/// `AgentRef` the connecting worker chose to Hello/subscribe with — not from any
/// identity independently verified against the broker's auth (a shared bearer
/// token authenticates the *connection*, not a claimed *role* on it). A worker
/// that connects with a bearer token valid for the broker can claim ANY role
/// string in its `AgentRef`, including one with a wider (or no) allowlist entry,
/// and the proxy has no way to tell it apart from a legitimately-deployed worker
/// of that role.
///
/// Concretely, this allowlist is:
/// - **Adequate** against a confused/hallucinating worker running its assigned
///   role honestly (the common case this issue targets — least-privilege
///   scoping so an LLM's tool-call mistake can't reach `nova_screenshot` from a
///   `researcher` role).
/// - **Not** a security boundary against a worker that is compromised or
///   deliberately malicious — such a worker can simply assert a role that is
///   unrestricted (or has a wider allowlist) and bypass this policy entirely.
///
/// Closing that gap needs authenticating the role itself (e.g. per-role broker
/// credentials, or signing the `AgentRef` at provisioning time) — out of scope
/// for this issue; deployers who need that guarantee should not rely on this
/// allowlist as their only control on a genuinely untrusted worker.
