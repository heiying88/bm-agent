//! Broker client. Connects, does the `Hello` handshake, then runs a background
//! reader that demuxes incoming frames into a `messages` stream and a
//! `delivered` receipt stream — so one connection can both deliver and
//! subscribe (the parent does both: deliver an Ask, subscribe for the Reply).
//!
//! TLS (`wss://`, #48): a bare `ws://` endpoint always worked unencrypted; a
//! `wss://` endpoint now works TWO ways —
//! - **CA-signed cert** (Let's Encrypt, a corporate/internal CA already
//!   installed in the OS trust store, …): zero configuration.
//!   [`BrokerClient::connect`] negotiates TLS against the OS's native root
//!   store (`tokio-tungstenite`'s `rustls-tls-native-roots` feature).
//! - **Self-signed cert** (the common homelab/cross-network quick-start):
//!   [`BrokerClient::connect_with_tls`] takes an explicit
//!   `rustls::ClientConfig` — build one with
//!   [`client_config_trusting_cert`] (or
//!   `bamboo_subagent::transport::client_config_trusting_cert` directly) to
//!   trust exactly the worker/broker's own cert with no OS trust-store
//!   changes.
