//! `RusshDeployer` — deploy a `broker-agent` worker over an in-process SSH
//! connection ([`russh`]) using STORED credentials (password / private key),
//! which system `ssh` cannot accept cleanly.
//!
//! It does everything the system-`ssh` path does, in-process:
//! 1. connect + host-key TOFU (pin the fingerprint; reject a changed key),
//! 2. authenticate with the decrypted password or private key,
//! 3. SFTP-upload the binary (hash-skip) + `chmod +x`,
//! 4. open a **reverse tunnel** (`tcpip_forward`) so the worker reaches the
//!    127.0.0.1-bound broker over the SSH connection — no inbound port on the
//!    remote — bridging each forwarded connection to the local broker,
//! 5. `exec` the worker pointed at the tunnel mouth.
//!
//! The returned [`DeployedAgent`] owns the live `russh` session: keeping it
//! alive keeps the tunnel + worker up; `shutdown`/`shutdown_with_timeout`
//! signal the remote worker and POLL for it to exit — keeping the session and
//! reverse tunnel up throughout, so an in-flight reply can drain through it —
//! before a bounded hard-kill fallback, reverse-listener cancellation, active
//! forwarding drain, and disconnect (session-bound lifetime, like the system-ssh
//! path — true survive-restart durability is a later phase). #489.
