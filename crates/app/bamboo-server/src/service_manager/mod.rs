//! `ServiceManager` — supervises long-running "service" plugins (issue #479,
//! prereq for epic #477's standalone connectors distributed as plugins).
//!
//! Sibling of `connect::ConnectManager` / `schedule_app::ScheduleManager`:
//! constructed once in `app_state::builder`, always alive, fully inert until
//! `start_service` is called. Neither existing precedent fits a resident
//! service process as-is:
//!
//! - `connect::ConnectManager` is too thin (no restart/health).
//! - `bamboo_mcp::manager::McpServerManager` is JSON-RPC-coupled
//!   (`ToolIndex`/QoS/circuit-breaker are meaningless for a service that
//!   speaks no MCP protocol at all).
//!
//! This module instead reuses the SHAPE of two `bamboo-mcp` patterns without
//! depending on that crate:
//!
//! - Spawn mechanics from `bamboo_mcp::transports::stdio` (`kill_on_drop`,
//!   `hide_window_for_tokio_command`, piped stdout/stderr → log lines via a
//!   dedicated reader task per stream — see [`lifecycle::spawn_stdio_logger`]).
//! - The health-check-drives-restart pattern from
//!   `bamboo_mcp::manager::lifecycle::start_health_check` /
//!   `manager::reconnect::attempt_reconnection`, generalized to
//!   [`bamboo_plugin::manifest::HealthCheckKind`]'s three kinds (process
//!   liveness is just "has the child exited", so only `Tcp`/`Http` need an
//!   actual polling task — see [`lifecycle::supervise_running_child`]) and to
//!   `bamboo_plugin::manifest::ShutdownSignal`'s graceful-then-hard-kill
//!   stop, mirroring `reconnect`'s exponential backoff.
//!
//! # Security: `env_clear()` before applying declared env
//!
//! Unlike `bamboo-mcp`'s stdio transport (which inherits bamboo-server's
//! FULL process environment — deliberately left alone, see that crate's
//! module docs), [`lifecycle::spawn_child`] calls `Command::env_clear()` and
//! then applies only a minimal `PATH`/`HOME`(+platform-runtime-essential)
//! allowlist before the manifest's declared `env` and
//! `BAMBOO_PLUGIN_SERVICE_CONFIG`. A service is the highest-trust plugin
//! artifact kind (a resident, unconstrained process) — see issue #479
//! security §2 — so it must not silently see every secret bamboo-server's own
//! environment happens to carry (API keys, tokens, etc).
//!
//! # `shutdown` vs `stop_token`
//!
//! Each [`ServiceRuntime`] carries a `shutdown: AtomicBool` (the issue's
//! explicit requirement) — the single source of truth `lifecycle` consults
//! after ANY wake to decide "was this an intentional stop" vs "should
//! `restart_policy` fire" — plus a `tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken` used
//! purely as the WAKE mechanism (interrupting an in-progress health-check
//! wait or restart backoff sleep). A bare `tokio::sync::Notify` was
//! considered and rejected: `notify_waiters` only wakes CURRENTLY-waiting
//! tasks, so a stop request arriving before the supervisor reaches its
//! `.notified().await` would be silently lost — `CancellationToken` has no
//! such race (once cancelled, `cancelled()` resolves immediately regardless
//! of call order).
//!
//! # Boot-time reconcile
//!
//! `app_state::builder` starts every ENABLED service from every plugin's
//! `installed.json` row in the background (mirrors
//! `app_state::init::init_mcp_manager`'s background MCP bootstrap) — a
//! service that is "supposed to run" (declared, enabled, plugin installed)
//! but has no live runtime (the previous `bamboo serve` process died) is
//! started fresh. See `app_state::builder`'s `boot_reconcile_services`.
