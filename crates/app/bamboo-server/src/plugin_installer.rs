//! `ServerPluginInstaller` — the `AppState`-backed implementation of
//! `bamboo_plugin::PluginInstaller` (Wave 2 § Installer-core agent,
//! `PLUGIN_PLAN.md`).
//!
//! `bamboo-plugin` is an `infra`-layer crate with no access to `AppState`, so
//! its `LocalPluginInstaller` reference skeleton stops at
//! `PluginError::NotImplemented` exactly where capability registration needs
//! `config.json`, `mcp_manager`, `prompt-presets.json`, and plugin discovery
//! roots. This type is the real implementation: an ordinary
//! downstream `impl PluginInstaller for ServerPluginInstaller` (the trait is
//! foreign, the type is local — no orphan-rule issue).
//!
//! # Why a borrowed `web::Data<AppState>`
//!
//! `ServerPluginInstaller` holds a `web::Data<AppState>` clone — the exact
//! handle every HTTP handler in this crate already receives as an argument
//! (`web::Data` is `Arc`-backed, so cloning it is cheap). An HTTP handler
//! constructs one per request: `ServerPluginInstaller::new(state.clone())`.
//! The installer coordinates the AppState-owned service manager and ToolEvent
//! router, so runtime registration and revocation share the same lifecycle
//! boundary as durable plugin provenance.
//!
//! # Path derivation: `state.app_data_dir`, not the `bamboo_config::paths` globals
//!
//! `bamboo_config::paths::{plugins_dir, workflows_dir, plugins_installed_json_path, ...}`
//! all resolve through a process-wide `OnceLock` that `AppState::new` seeds
//! ONCE per process (first caller wins — see its doc comment). That is
//! correct for the single production `AppState` per process, but this
//! crate's own test suite already builds many `AppState`s over different
//! `tempfile::tempdir()`s in the same test binary (e.g.
//! `app_state::tests::test_app_state_creation` and friends) — if this type
//! read the global helpers, every one of those `AppState`s would silently
//! share whichever tempdir happened to construct the first one. Every path
//! below is instead derived from the borrowed `state.app_data_dir` field
//! directly, exactly the pattern `handlers::settings::workflows` and
//! `prompt_presets::storage::store_file_path` already use. In production,
//! where there is exactly one `AppState`, this resolves to the identical
//! path the global helpers would have produced.
//!
//! # Concurrency
//!
//! Every `install`/`uninstall` runs under a single process-wide async lock
//! ([`PLUGIN_OP_LOCK`]), held for the ENTIRE operation including rollback, so
//! the reconcile→mutate→provenance sequence is atomic w.r.t. any other plugin
//! op. This closes three concurrency gaps at once: the `installed.json` and
//! `prompt-presets.json` load/modify/save lost-update races, and the MCP
//! reconcile→config-write TOCTOU. As additional defense against a concurrent
//! NON-plugin config write (which does not take this lock), the MCP step also
//! RE-runs its ownership pre-check INSIDE the `update_config` closure, under
//! `config_io_lock`, and aborts rather than clobbering if a foreign entry
//! appeared. Lock ordering is `PLUGIN_OP_LOCK` → `config_io_lock` (never the
//! reverse) — see [`PLUGIN_OP_LOCK`].
//!
//! Plugin workflow markdown is never copied into the user's global workflow
//! directory. It remains inside the plugin bundle and is discovered in place
//! by the SkillStore, so plugin install cannot overwrite a same-named user
//! source and needs no shared workflow-file lock.
//!
//! # Crash safety (process killed mid-install)
//!
//! In-process rollback (below) only fires on an `Err`. A HARD kill after the
//! MCP step wrote to `config.json` but before provenance is committed would,
//! without a journal, leave: `reconcile_exclusive` seeing the orphaned mcp id
//! as existing-but-not-owned → a false `Conflict` on the retry, AND
//! `uninstall` returning `NotFound` (no provenance) → the user stuck
//! hand-editing `config.json`. To prevent that, `install` writes a provenance
//! row with status [`PluginInstallStatus::Installing`] — recording the
//! INTENDED ownership set — BEFORE steps 1-4, and flips it to
//! [`PluginInstallStatus::Installed`] only after step 5 succeeds. On the next
//! install/upgrade of an id whose row is still `Installing` (a prior crash),
//! [`load_previous_for_disposition`] returns it as `previous` (it does NOT
//! trip `AlreadyInstalled`), so its intended set is treated as
//! this-plugin-owned — the leftover reads as an `OwnedReinstall`, not a
//! foreign conflict — and is cleaned up as an upgrade-over-incomplete.
//! `uninstall` works on an `Installing` row too.
//!
//! # Atomicity / rollback semantics
//!
//! `install()` follows `PLUGIN_PLAN.md`'s numbered sequence exactly:
//!
//! 0. **Upgrade drop-diff** (only when upgrading an already-installed id):
//!    de-register whatever the new manifest no longer declares, computed via
//!    [`bamboo_plugin::registry::RegisteredCapabilities::removed_since`],
//!    BEFORE registering anything new. De-registration is idempotent/
//!    best-effort (see [`ServerPluginInstaller::deregister_capabilities`]) —
//!    an entry a user already removed by hand never blocks an upgrade.
//! 1. **MCP** — ownership-checked (REFUSE on a foreign conflict, via
//!    [`bamboo_plugin::registry::reconcile_exclusive`]), merged into
//!    `config.json`, started.
//! 2. **Prompts** — rename-on-collision (never refuse), appended to
//!    `prompt-presets.json`.
//! 3. **Workflows** — validated for safe in-place discovery; no shared-store
//!    copy or ownership mutation.
//! 4. **Skills** — nothing to register (discovered in place); just recorded.
//! 5. **Provenance commit** — `installed.json` is only ever upserted after
//!    steps 0-4 all succeed.
//!
//! Steps 1-2 are real, sequential mutations (config then prompt-store writes)
//! — NOT a dry-run computed up front — because `PLUGIN_PLAN.md`
//! requires the ownership pre-checks to run in that exact order against the
//! LIVE state each step leaves behind. That means a HARD failure at step 2
//! or the workflow validation in step 3 can happen after step 1 already wrote
//! real entries into `config.json`. [`ServerPluginInstaller::install`] tracks
//! every already-applied mutation in an [`InstallRollback`] and, on any hard
//! failure from steps 1-3, best-effort UNDOES them (removes the mcp entries
//! it just added and stops any it started, removes the presets it just
//! appended, and removes services it started) before returning the
//! error — so a caller's retry starts from a clean slate. Provenance is
//! never written on a failed path (step 5 is the only place `installed.json`
//! is touched on success), which is the minimum safety bar even if a rollback
//! step itself only partially succeeds (rollback operations are themselves
//! idempotent/log-and-continue, so a second rollback attempt via a plain
//! retry can never fail louder than the first).
//!
//! The production HTTP path prepares source bytes in an isolated directory,
//! then retains [`PluginOperationGuard`] across global ownership preflight,
//! old-service shutdown, bundle activation, registration, and rollback. The
//! on-disk swap therefore shares the same serialization boundary as the
//! provenance/config mutations. Standalone callers of the lower-level trait
//! remain responsible for staging serialization; see `crate::plugin_source`.
//!
//! Prompt-preset drop-diff caveat: the upgrade drop-diff compares the NEW
//! manifest's nominal preset ids against the OLD install's ACTUAL (possibly
//! renamed-on-collision) registered ids. A preset that got renamed at its
//! original install time and is still declared under its original nominal id
//! in the new manifest will look "dropped" (the nominal id is absent from the
//! actual old set) and get re-appended (possibly renamed again). This is
//! harmless — preset content is just refreshed under a fresh id — and not
//! worth a stable-id-mapping schema change for what `RegisteredCapabilities`
//! already documents as the one rename (not refuse) exception.
