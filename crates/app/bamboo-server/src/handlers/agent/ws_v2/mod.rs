//! v2-P1 unified WebSocket multiplex: `GET /v2/stream`.
//!
//! One WebSocket replaces the two v1 SSE streams (`GET /events/{id}` +
//! `GET /stream`) plus a minimal `stop` control uplink, so a mobile client uses
//! ONE connection instead of two SSE + scattered POSTs. The v1 SSE/REST
//! endpoints stay UNCHANGED (dual-track per `docs/api-v2-transport.md` §8.1).
//!
//! ## Channels (server→client)
//! - `feed` — the account `ChangeEvent` stream (reuses `plan_replay` + journal).
//! - `agent.{session_id}` — a per-session `AgentEvent` stream (reuses the v1
//!   critical-event replay + the v1 `Coalescer` for token batching).
//!
//! ## Control (client→server, P1)
//! - `stop` only — cancels a session (reuses the v1 stop discipline).
//!
//! ## Design
//! Each subscribed channel runs its OWN forwarder task with its OWN broadcast
//! receiver (per-channel lag independence; §10-Q3) AND its OWN bounded outbound
//! `mpsc` queue. The driver holds a `StreamMap<channel, ReceiverStream>` and
//! drains every per-channel queue with a fair (randomized-start) merge, so a burst
//! on one channel can no longer head-of-line another at the socket (RFC §10-Q3 —
//! see `forwarders.rs` for the honest fairness guarantee). A per-channel
//! `JoinHandle` lets `unsubscribe`/teardown abort exactly that forwarder and drop
//! its queue, leaving no orphaned broadcast reader.
//!
//! ## Encoding (v2-P3, #181)
//! The wire encoding is negotiated ONCE at the upgrade from the offered
//! `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`: `bamboo.v2.msgpack` selects binary MessagePack,
//! anything else (or nothing) stays JSON text (the default — desktop /
//! debuggability). The SAME envelope schema is carried either way; only the
//! serialization + WS frame type (Text vs Binary) differs. See `envelope::Encoding`.
//!
//! ## DEFERRED (later slices; see PR / §5.3)
//! - `execute` / `approve` over control (handler refactors) — clients keep REST.
//!
//! ## Auth (v2-P2, #181 / #189)
//! `/v2/stream` is on the public route whitelist, so the upgrade OPENS without
//! a middleware credential — this is the only way a browser device-token client
//! (which cannot set `Authorization`/`X-Device-Id` headers on a WS upgrade) can
//! present its token, via the `hello` frame. The handler is therefore the
//! AUTHORITATIVE gate:
//!
//! - `pre_authorized` is computed from the SAME allow-decision the middleware
//!   uses for every other route (`request_is_authorized`): a local bypass, a
//!   verified password cookie (cookies ARE sent on the upgrade), or a header
//!   device token. These connections stay frictionless — exactly as before.
//! - While NOT authorized, the ONLY frame that does anything is `hello` carrying
//!   a VALID `device_id` + `token`. A `subscribe`/`unsubscribe`/`stop` received
//!   before authorization is IGNORED — no forwarder, no cancel, no channel data.
//! - A token-less `hello` NEVER authorizes a connection that wasn't already
//!   pre-authorized.
//! - The first successfully authorized `hello` receives one reliable top-level
//!   `{"type":"welcome"}` frame in the negotiated encoding. It is written
//!   directly by the socket owner; later accepted hellos do not duplicate it.
//! - An unauthenticated socket that never sends a valid `hello` within
//!   [`AUTH_DEADLINE`] is CLOSED, so it cannot linger.
//! - The token is NEVER logged.
