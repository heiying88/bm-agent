//! Plugin source staging (Wave 2 § Installer-core agent, `PLUGIN_PLAN.md`
//! Deliverable B): turns whatever the caller (CLI/HTTP) pointed the
//! installer at — a local directory, a local `.zip`/`.tar.gz`/`.tgz`
//! archive, or a URL — into a validated bundle at `plugins_dir()/<id>/`,
//! ready to hand to [`bamboo_plugin::PluginInstaller::install`].
//!
//! # The three sources
//!
//! - [`PluginSourceInput::LocalDir`] — copies the directory tree.
//! - [`PluginSourceInput::LocalArchive`] — unpacks a `.zip`/`.tar.gz`/`.tgz`.
//!   If the archive wraps everything in a single top-level directory (the
//!   common `tar czf bundle.tar.gz plugin-name/` convention), that directory
//!   is flattened up so `plugin.json` ends up at the bundle root either way.
//! - [`PluginSourceInput::Url`] — fetches the manifest bundle (a bare
//!   `plugin.json`, content-only and typically an MCP server backed entirely
//!   by a downloadable binary — e.g. a nova-style plugin with no bundled
//!   skills/prompts — or an archive containing one, same flattening rule as
//!   `LocalArchive`). **Three trust layers, stacked, enforced in
//!   [`fetch_manifest_bundle`] in this order:**
//!
//!   1. **Host allowlist (source authorization)** — is the URL's `<host><path>`
//!      one the operator has trusted (`bamboo_config::PluginTrustConfig::trusted_hosts`)?
//!      Refused BEFORE any network access ([`PluginError::UntrustedHost`])
//!      unless `allow_untrusted_host` is set.
//!   2. **Signature (publisher authenticity)** — after the bundle is
//!      downloaded, does its `<url>.sig` sidecar (a raw 64-byte ed25519
//!      signature, hex-encoded, over the exact bundle bytes) verify against
//!      any `bamboo_config::TrustedKey` in `trusted_keys`? Refused
//!      ([`PluginError::UnsignedOrUntrustedSignature`]) unless `allow_unsigned`
//!      is set.
//!   3. **Checksum (integrity)** — same sha256 pin as before, EXCEPT a
//!      verified signature from layer 2 already proves integrity+authenticity
//!      more strongly than a pasted hash could, so it SATISFIES this layer's
//!      requirement even with neither `sha256` nor `allow_unverified` given
//!      (an `allow_unsigned` bypass grants no such credit — an unsigned
//!      install still needs its own sha256/allow_unverified exactly as
//!      before). See [`fetch_manifest_bundle`] for the precise precedence.
//!
//!   A pasted checksum ALONE never establishes source trust — it is circular
//!   if the attacker controls the page the checksum was copied from — which
//!   is why layers 1 and 2 exist independently of layer 3.
//!
//!   Byte-authenticity note: the host allowlist only vets the FIRST hop's
//!   `<host><path>`, not wherever an HTTP redirect might lead — a signature
//!   or checksum is what actually authenticates the downloaded bytes, so
//!   redirects are followed whenever either will be checked, but disabled
//!   entirely for the fully-opted-out `allow_unsigned && sha256.is_none()`
//!   case, where the host allowlist is the sole control (see
//!   [`http_client_no_redirects`]).
//!
//! # `--insecure` / `plugin_trust.enforcement`: skip ALL three layers at once
//!
//! The three `allow_*` opt-outs above are per-layer. On top of them,
//! [`PluginSourceInput::Url::insecure`] is a convenience AGGREGATE — set it
//! (CLI: `--insecure`; HTTP: `"insecure": true` on the `url` source) and
//! [`fetch_manifest_bundle`] treats `allow_untrusted_host`, `allow_unsigned`
//! AND `allow_unverified` as all `true` for that one install, without the
//! caller spelling out all three. There is also a PERSISTENT, config-level
//! form for an operator who never wants to pass flags at all:
//! `bamboo_config::PluginTrustConfig::enforcement` set to
//! `PluginTrustEnforcement::Off` makes EVERY `url` install/update behave as
//! if `--insecure` were passed, with no per-install flag needed. Precedence,
//! in both cases:
//!
//! - The aggregate ONLY turns per-layer checks OFF — it never turns off a
//!   check the caller opted INTO. A supplied `sha256` is still hashed and
//!   compared; a mismatch is still [`PluginError::BundleVerificationFailed`],
//!   `--insecure`/`enforcement: off` or not. So `--insecure --sha256 <hex>`
//!   means "skip host/signature enforcement AND the bare
//!   sha256-required-by-default rule, but still verify THIS hash".
//! - The per-layer flags keep working independently — a caller who wants to
//!   waive just the host allowlist (say) still passes
//!   `--allow-untrusted-host` alone; the aggregate is a shortcut for "all
//!   three", not a replacement for them.
//! - `plugin_trust.enforcement` defaults to `Strict` (secure by default) for
//!   both a fresh config and one with no `plugin_trust.enforcement` key at
//!   all — this is opt-in relaxation, never a silent weakening.
//!
//! Every install where the aggregate is active — via `insecure: true` on the
//! request OR `plugin_trust.enforcement: off` — logs a prominent
//! `tracing::warn!` naming the source URL, and records `insecure: true` in
//! the resulting `PluginSource::Url` provenance (`bamboo plugin list`/audit
//! can then tell these installs apart from ones where the same three
//! individual `allow_*` flags merely happened to all be set). A server
//! booting with `plugin_trust.enforcement: off` also logs its own startup
//! warning (see `AppState::new`), since that setting silently affects EVERY
//! future install, not just one command invocation.
//!
//!   THEN, separately, for [`Platform::current`] (if the manifest declares an
//!   artifact for it), fetches the per-platform binary archive named in
//!   `manifest.artifacts`, verifies its sha256 BEFORE unpacking (mandatory —
//!   a URL plugin ships a binary that gets executed), and places the single
//!   expected executable at `bin/<platform>/<id>[.exe]` per
//!   [`bamboo_plugin::manifest::PluginArtifact`]'s archive contract. This
//!   artifact-sha256 check is unaffected by the host/signature layers above
//!   (the artifact URL is declared inside a manifest that has ALREADY passed
//!   all three trust layers) — it remains defense in depth for the binary
//!   specifically, closing the gap where the artifact's own declared hash
//!   lives inside the bundle that carries it.
//!
//! All three paths run the SAME safety checks: [`PluginManifest::validate`]
//! before anything is committed to `plugins_dir()`, and path-traversal-safe
//! archive extraction (a zip entry's [`zip::read::ZipFile::enclosed_name`]
//! rejects `..`/absolute entries outright; a tar entry's path is checked for
//! `ParentDir`/root/prefix components before extraction) — a malicious
//! archive must not be able to write outside its own staging directory.
//!
//! # Swap safety (why an upgrade doesn't lose the old bundle on failure)
//!
//! `plugin_dir` is a fixed path per id (`plugins_dir()/<id>/`), so an upgrade
//! necessarily replaces whatever is already there. [`prepare_plugin_source`]
//! builds the new bundle in a scratch `.staging-*` directory first (so a bad
//! source — invalid manifest, failed download, sha256 mismatch — never
//! touches the existing install). The server-owned transaction seam then holds
//! the plugin-operation lock while auditing global ownership; only an accepted
//! [`PreparedPlugin`] is activated, after which the OLD `plugin_dir` is moved
//! aside to a `.backup-*` directory (not deleted) and the candidate is renamed
//! into place. The private staged transaction carries exact directory
//! identities for the candidate and backup. On install failure it quarantines
//! the live entry, and restores only an identity-verified backup with
//! NOREPLACE. An ambiguous destination, candidate, or backup is preserved and
//! requires manual recovery. Once an upgrade has stopped an old service, any
//! later failure deliberately leaves it stopped for an operator to reconcile;
//! source recovery never starts executable code automatically. Production
//! exposes only [`install_server_plugin_from_source`];
//! low-level staging helpers exist under `cfg(test)` and cannot bypass the
//! server's ownership preflight or operation lock.
//!
//! Residual gap (documented, not solved here): the plugin_dir swap itself and
//! `install()`'s own capability-registration rollback (see
//! `crate::plugin_installer`'s module docs) are two separate best-effort
//! steps, not one atomic transaction. If the process crashes between the
//! swap and `install()` returning, a retry is still safe (staging always
//! starts from a fresh scratch dir; a leftover `.backup-*`/`.staging-*` dir
//! is inert and can be swept by an operator or a future cleanup pass) but is
//! not automatic today.
//!
//! # Known follow-ups (deferred — tracked here, not fixed on this branch)
//!
//! - **URL content-bundle integrity pin: IMPLEMENTED (secure by default).**
//!   Previously only the per-platform BINARY artifact was sha256-pinned
//!   (`PluginArtifact.sha256`, verified in [`fetch_and_place_artifact`]),
//!   while the `plugin.json` / content archive fetched by
//!   [`fetch_manifest_bundle`] was trusted on HTTPS alone — a MITM or a
//!   compromised host could serve a tampered bundle, and since the binary's
//!   sha256 is DECLARED INSIDE that same untrusted manifest, tampering the
//!   bundle could rewrite the artifact hash too (the trust chain was
//!   circular). Fixed: [`PluginSourceInput::Url`] now carries a `sha256`
//!   (the expected hash of the downloaded bundle) and an `allow_unverified`
//!   opt-out. [`fetch_manifest_bundle`] verifies the bundle's actual sha256
//!   against it BEFORE any extraction/parsing on a mismatch
//!   ([`PluginError::BundleVerificationFailed`]); with neither a `sha256`
//!   nor `allow_unverified: true`, the fetch is refused up front — before
//!   the URL is ever requested — with [`PluginError::ChecksumRequired`]. A
//!   URL install can therefore no longer just download-and-trust any
//!   tar.gz. The verified bundle sha256 (not the binary artifact's) is what
//!   `PluginSource::Url.sha256` records for provenance/audit.
//! - **Source-TRUST layer: IMPLEMENTED** (host allowlist + ed25519 publisher
//!   signature — see the module-level "three trust layers" summary above and
//!   [`fetch_manifest_bundle`]). A sha256 pin alone only proves "this is the
//!   bytes the installer expected", not "an entity I trust produced them" —
//!   and worse, a checksum pasted from the SAME page as a malicious URL is
//!   circular, proving nothing about the source. `bamboo_config::PluginTrustConfig`
//!   (`trusted_hosts` + `trusted_keys`, both user-editable in `config.json`)
//!   closes that: a URL install now also needs an operator-trusted host and
//!   (absent `allow_unsigned`) a bundle signature verifying against a trusted
//!   key. Still deferred:
//!   - **SSRF guard**, described next.
//! - **No SSRF guard on URL fetch.** [`download_bytes`] will fetch any URL,
//!   including `http://169.254.169.254/...` (cloud metadata) or private-range
//!   / loopback addresses. In a hosted/multi-tenant deployment a plugin-install
//!   URL is an SSRF vector. A private-IP / metadata-endpoint blocklist (or an
//!   allowlist of plugin registries) is a threat-model call for the deploy
//!   layer; noted here so it isn't forgotten.
//! - **`prompt-presets.json`'s `save_store` is non-atomic** (`fs::write` in
//!   place, pre-existing behaviour shared with the HTTP prompt-preset
//!   handlers): a crash mid-write can truncate `prompt-presets.json`. A
//!   write-to-temp-then-rename would make it atomic, matching what
//!   `bamboo_plugin::registry::InstalledPlugins::save` (`installed.json`) now
//!   does; deferred here as a change to a shared, pre-existing storage
//!   helper rather than this branch's new code.
//!
//! Production install/update handlers retain one `PLUGIN_OP_LOCK` guard across
//! ownership preflight, service shutdown, activation, install, and rollback,
//! so shared server state has no preflight-to-swap race.
