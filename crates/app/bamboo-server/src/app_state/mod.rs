//! Unified application state management for the Bamboo server
//!
//! This module provides the central AppState struct that consolidates all
//! server state including sessions, storage, LLM providers, tools, and metrics.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The AppState uses a unified design that eliminates the proxy pattern where
//! web_service created an AgentAppState that called back via HTTP. Instead, it
//! provides direct access to all components.
//!

//! # Key Features
//!
//! - **Hot-reloadable configuration**: Config and provider can be reloaded at runtime
//! - **Direct provider access**: No HTTP proxy overhead
//! - **Session management**: In-memory session cache with persistent storage
//! - **Tool composition**: Combines built-in and MCP tools
//! - **Metrics collection**: Integrated metrics and event tracking
//!
//! # Usage Example
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use bamboo_server::app_state::AppState;
//! use std::path::PathBuf;
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!     // Initialize app state
//!     let app_data_dir = PathBuf::from("/path/to/.bamboo");
//!     let state = AppState::new(app_data_dir)
//!         .await
//!         .expect("failed to initialize app state");
//!
//!     // Access components
//!     let provider = state.get_provider().await;
//!     let schemas = state.get_all_tool_schemas();
//!
//!     // Hot reload configuration
//!     state.reload_config().await;
//!     state.reload_provider().await.ok();
//! }
//! ```
