//! ProvisionSpec — the one-shot bootstrap contract between parent and worker.
//!
//! The parent **decides** (model routing, tool policy, storage layout, credentials) and the
//! worker only **executes** the already-resolved result. The spec is fed to the worker over
//! **stdin, once, then the pipe closes** — never argv (visible in `ps`) or env (inherited by
//! grandchildren). Secrets ride in a dedicated envelope so the security story can evolve
//! (proxy mode, short-lived tokens) without touching the bootstrap flow.
//!
//! Forward compatibility: `version` + serde's default of ignoring unknown fields means an
//! older worker can read a newer spec (new fields are skipped) and a newer worker can read
//! an older spec (missing fields default). Parent and worker binaries need not be upgraded
//! in lockstep.
//! Authority-bearing required capabilities are an exception: the parent must
//! receive their explicit capability acknowledgement before any provision.
