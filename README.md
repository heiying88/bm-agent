## What is this

Bamboo is the "brain" of an AI assistant that runs on your own machine. It does far more than chat — it takes notes, grows a searchable long-term memory, uses tools (read/write files, run commands, search the web), and automatically compacts very long conversations so the assistant never "forgets" or grinds to a halt. All of this lives inside one compact, self-hostable program, with your data staying local by default.

If Bodhi is the AI product you see, **Bamboo is the engine running underneath it.**

## Architecture

Bamboo is a Cargo **workspace**: a thin root binary (`bamboo-agent`, which exposes the `bamboo` command) sits on top of focused crates organized into four tiers — `crates/core/` (types + interfaces), `crates/infra/` (independent services), `crates/engine/` (core logic), and `crates/app/` (executables + entry points). The live server is `crates/app/bamboo-server` (there is no duplicate server tree). `bamboo-agent-core` depends **only** on `bamboo-domain`, keeping the core abstractions clean.

**Workspace members** (from `Cargo.toml`), organized by tier:

- **`crates/core/`** — `bamboo-domain` (pure domain types), `bamboo-agent-core` (core abstractions)
- **`crates/infra/`** — `bamboo-config`, `bamboo-llm`, `bamboo-storage`, `bamboo-a2a`, `bamboo-infrastructure`, `bamboo-memory`, `bamboo-metrics`, `bamboo-notification`, `bamboo-skills`, `bamboo-mcp`, `bamboo-permission`, `bamboo-compression`, `bamboo-subagent`, `bamboo-hooks`, `bamboo-analytics` (dev-only)
- **`crates/engine/`** — `bamboo-engine`, `bamboo-tools`
- **`crates/app/`** — `bamboo-server`, `bamboo-server-tools`, `bamboo-sdk`, `bamboo-tui`, `bamboo-client-core`, `bamboo-broker`

…plus the root `bamboo-agent` binary.

**Place in the Zenith stack:** Bodhi is the Tauri desktop shell that starts or reuses a local `bamboo serve`, waits for `GET /api/v1/health`, and manages the sidecar lifecycle. Bamboo now embeds the verified Lotus Next artifact by default; a shell may still provide an explicit external frontend package during the staged migration. Lotus Next sends requests over HTTP and receives live events through one shared `/v2/stream` WebSocket by default; the legacy account and session SSE feeds are fallbacks when the v2 transport is explicitly disabled or its initial WebSocket connection cannot be established. Bamboo remains the execution engine. `bodhi-server` is a separate, optional hosted account and provider path; the local Bodhi → Bamboo → Lotus Next path does not require it.

## Signature Deep-Dives

### Memory System · Jiandu through `crates/infra/bamboo-memory`

Bamboo does not maintain a second memory implementation. Its narrow `bamboo-memory` facade delegates canonical storage, deterministic lexical retrieval, session notes, and Dream snapshots to the exact `jiandu-memory` release.

Jiandu owns canonical persistence, derived indexes, lexical recall, and the persisted Dream snapshot bytes. Bamboo owns prompt selection and budget, may optionally rerank a recalled shortlist, and chooses the model and cadence used to refresh Dream; it does not duplicate Jiandu's memory engine.

- **Session notes** — the `session_note` tool (`read` / `append` / `replace` / `clear` / `list_topics`) keeps compression-resistant context for one session.
- **Durable memory** — atomic Global or first-class Project facts with type, status, source, relations, and lexical retrieval metadata. Jiandu is the source of truth; there is no embedding pipeline.
- **Dream** — a Jiandu-owned derived Global or Project orientation snapshot, never a canonical memory record. Bamboo extracts facts and Ledger candidates first, captures the Jiandu generation, reads canonical `MEMORY.md`, synthesizes once, then asks Jiandu to publish with compare-and-swap so a stale run cannot overwrite newer facts.

Jiandu defaults to the independent `~/.jiandu` data root. Bamboo configuration, sessions, and the prospective-record Ledger remain under `~/.bamboo`; the two stores are not mixed. For an isolated managed-host or acceptance run, `BAMBOO_JIANDU_DATA_DIR` may select a non-empty absolute Jiandu root for the server process and every local Bamboo-runtime worker it spawns. Invalid values stop the server or worker before memory initialization. This is an isolation boundary, not a second persistence mode or a migration mechanism, and `--data-dir` continues to control Bamboo data only.

**Prompt-memory observations.** The canonical native agent loop can record which
compact relevant-memory records it supplied when a provider stream successfully
bootstraps. Schema v1 keeps the first such observation for an execution-scoped
logical round: retries do not increase its frequency or replace its membership,
while a new execution/resume has a new round identity. This is host-side prompt
exposure, not proof of provider processing, model adoption, or a full `memory get`.

- Only trusted Project item IDs, lifecycle status, final rank and character
  counts are retained. Headers also distinguish empty/disabled/failed recall and
  count Global fallback without storing Global IDs. Jiandu v0.2.0 currently
  chooses Project hits or Global fallback, not a mixed set; the observation
  schema can represent mixed counts without assigning Global IDs to a Project.
  Overall recall eligibility is not a Project lookup attempt or a Project
  retrieval hit-rate denominator.
- Records use the existing best-effort metrics collector and `metrics.db`, with
  the existing 90-day round retention. Queued observations can be lost on a crash
  or storage failure; this is not complete lifetime history or crash-exact delivery.
- This captures the current round's fresh compact selection, not old memory text
  retained in the append-only transcript. Management browsing and direct tool
  execution do not emit observations; execution adapters without provenance are
  unsupported coverage, not observed zeroes. There is no historical backfill.

This producer does not add an aggregation endpoint or dashboard, alter Jiandu's
canonical data, or store memory bodies, summaries, queries, prompts or outputs.

**Gardener** (`bamboo-engine/src/gardener.rs`) specializes in splitting multi-topic blobs and consolidating duplicates. It has a hard per-run cap and **calls no LLM when the deterministic pre-screen finds no candidates**; only the model-reviewed maintenance decision has model cost.

> Why it matters: the memory system lets the assistant understand your project better over long-term use, while keeping cost controlled and data local.

### Context Compression · `crates/infra/bamboo-compression`

Long conversations don't grow without bound. Bamboo uses a **hybrid strategy**: a rolling summary + a recent message window.

- `counter` — counts tokens via tiktoken BPE or heuristic estimation (`TiktokenTokenCounter` / `HeuristicTokenCounter`).
- `segmenter` — preserves the atomicity of tool calls when segmenting (it won't split a single tool call apart).
- `limits` — **deliberately ships no per-model table**. Explicit user overrides in `model_limits.json` take precedence over provider runtime metadata; with neither, Bamboo falls back to **1M total input+output context / 32K per-request output allowance**. Prompt fitting reserves the output allowance and tokenizer safety margin from that total window, and root sessions re-read the instance-local override file each round.
- `summarizer` / `preparation` — builds the compression plan, generates the summary message, prepares context against the budget (`prepare_hybrid_context`), and can estimate prompt-cache savings.
- **Oversized output** — oversized output produced by tools is trimmed/managed at `bamboo-tools/output_manager.rs`, avoiding stuffing the context all at once.

> Why it matters: the assistant can do long, multi-step work without crashing from context overflow or "losing its memory."

### Skill System · `crates/infra/bamboo-skills`

Skills are enableable capability bundles. At runtime it resolves the "selected skills" from session metadata (supporting JSON arrays or the legacy comma-separated format), and performs lightweight, request-hint-based relevance selection for **unselected skills** to inject into context (capped at `MAX_UNSELECTED_SKILLS_IN_CONTEXT = 24`), avoiding stuffing every skill into the prompt. It also includes access control and runtime metadata.

Built-in skills live in `builtin_skills/`: `docx`, `pdf`, `pptx`, `xlsx`, `skill-creator`.

### Tools, Workflows, Schedules, MCP

- **Tools** (`bamboo-tools`, **19 built-in**, registered in `executor.rs::register_builtin_tools`): `Bash`, `BashInput`, `BashOutput`, `KillShell`, `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `GetFileInfo`, `ViewImage`, `Workspace`, `WebFetch`, `Task`, `Sleep`, `ExitPlanMode`, `request_permissions`, `session_note`, and `update_goal`. Tools come with **usage guides** injected at runtime, a **permission/policy-aware** execution path, and parallel execution support (`parallel.rs`).
- **Workflows** — declarative loading (`bamboo-server/src/workflow/loader.rs`), exposed via `/bamboo/workflows`.
- **Schedules** — a cron-style trigger engine and store (`bamboo-server/src/schedules/`: `manager`, `trigger_engine`, `session_factory`, `store`).
- **MCP** — Model Context Protocol client (`crates/infra/bamboo-mcp/`: `manager`, `protocol`, `transports`, `tool_index`), managing external tool servers via the `/mcp`, `/servers` routes.

## Quick Start & Development

Building Bamboo from source requires **Rust 1.95 or newer**.

### First-run setup

Configure a provider + API key without hand-editing JSON:

```bash
# interactive — prompts for provider + API key (uses a default model unless --model is given)
bamboo init

# or non-interactive (CI / scripting)
bamboo init --non-interactive --provider anthropic --api-key "sk-ant-..."

# verify the install (config present, provider keyed, server reachable)
bamboo doctor

# set/rotate a single value later
bamboo config set providers.openai.api_key "sk-..."
bamboo config set provider openai
```

`init` writes `~/.bamboo/config.json` (override with `--data-dir`) and stores the key **encrypted at rest**. `doctor` exits non-zero if a blocking problem is found, so it doubles as a readiness check.

### Run the server

```bash
# build & run from the workspace
cargo run --bin bamboo -- serve

# or install then run
cargo install --path .
bamboo serve
```

Arguments supported by `bamboo serve` (all override the config file):
`--port`, `--bind`, `--data-dir`, `--static-dir`, `--workers` (plus `--parent-pid`, a sidecar orphan-guard: the process exits when that PID goes away).

### Frontend build contract

Normal Bamboo builds require the staged frontend package owned by
`crates/app/bamboo-server/frontend_package`. The repository default is the exact
`@bigduu/lotus-next` release recorded in `scripts/frontend-package-lock.json`.
The build validates the sidecar manifest, the matching manifest inside the zip,
portable archive paths and payload integrity, the `index.html` entry, and the
manifest hash shape. The staging verifier additionally checks the upstream
universal manifest, complete resource inventory, per-resource digests, clean
source revision, and locked package identity. Missing, stale, or invalid assets
stop the build instead of silently producing an API-only server.

The normal command verifies and reuses those committed bytes without selecting
an adjacent checkout:

```bash
node scripts/frontend-package.cjs stage
```

To refresh the lock deliberately, first update and review the lock file, install
that exact public package, then stage it explicitly:

```bash
LOTUS_NEXT_VERSION="$(node -p "require('./scripts/frontend-package-lock.json').packageVersion")"
npm install --no-save --no-package-lock "@bigduu/lotus-next@${LOTUS_NEXT_VERSION}"
LOTUS_SOURCE=package node scripts/frontend-package.cjs stage
```

`LOTUS_SOURCE=local` and `stage:prebuilt` remain explicit developer paths for a
clean, self-identifying Lotus Next build. The crate and Docker release workflows
use the same committed Lotus Next lock by default, including tag-triggered
Docker builds; they never resolve a moving npm `latest` tag. Their
`frontend_package` input is the single release-time rollback selector. Choosing
legacy Lotus pins `@bigduu/lotus@2026.8.28`; an unsupported package, `latest`,
or a version inconsistent with the selected fixed artifact fails before npm
installation. Remove this transitional legacy choice only after the rollback
window tracked by `bigduu/Zenith#187` is complete.

Cargo never runs that staging command implicitly. This removes the previous
ignored child-process status: explicit local and GitHub Actions callers receive
the stager's nonzero exit status before `build.rs` validates the resulting
crate-owned bytes.

An intentionally frontend-free binary remains available for infrastructure
that supplies only Bamboo APIs. Select it at build time (never as an implicit
fallback):

```bash
BAMBOO_FRONTEND_BUILD_MODE=api-only cargo build --bin bamboo
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:BAMBOO_FRONTEND_BUILD_MODE = "api-only"
cargo build --bin bamboo
```

That setting disables only the compiled-in package. At runtime, `--static-dir`
still has the highest-level static-directory behavior. An explicitly configured
`BAMBOO_FRONTEND_PACKAGE` takes precedence over the compiled package and fails
closed when the path, zip, or adjacent sidecar is missing or invalid. Treat that
variable as the single artifact-level rollback input: it must name a complete,
known-good Lotus Next zip accompanied by its byte-matching
`frontend-manifest.json`. Legacy package candidates beside the working directory
or executable are considered only when no compiled package and no explicit
package configuration exists.

**Other subcommands** (`bamboo --help` / `bamboo <cmd> --help` for the full list):

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `bamboo serve` | Start the HTTP/WebSocket/SSE server (above). |
| `bamboo tui` | Full-screen terminal client (chat, sessions, MCP, schedules, skills, config) over a running server; offers to auto-start a local one when unreachable (`--auto-serve`/`--no-auto-serve`). |
| `bamboo init` | First-run setup: write `config.json` with a provider + API key (interactive, or `--non-interactive` for CI). |
| `bamboo doctor` | Diagnose the install (config present, provider keyed, server reachable); exits non-zero on a blocking problem. |
| `bamboo config [--path] [--show-secrets]` | Inspect the resolved configuration. |
| `bamboo config set <key> <value>` | Set one value by dotted key. Secret-aware keys (`providers.<p>.api_key`, `provider_instances.<id>.api_key`, `notifications.ntfy.token`, `notifications.bark.device_key`) are stored encrypted at rest; every other key is a generic validated dot-path (e.g. `server.port 9563`, `tools.disabled '["Bash"]'`) — JSON values are parsed as JSON, unknown keys / type mismatches are rejected before writing. `--dry-run` previews the diff. |
| `bamboo -p "<prompt>"` | One-shot **headless** agent run (boots the full runtime incl. sub-agents, prints the result, exits). Use `-p -` to read the prompt from stdin. Optional `-s <session>` to continue, `-m provider:model` **or** a bare `-m <model>` (bound to `--provider`, else the configured default provider) to pin the model, `--provider <name>` to select a provider, `--reasoning-effort <low\|medium\|high\|xhigh>`, `--skill-mode <mode>`, `--workspace`, `--data-dir`, `--stream-json` (NDJSON on stdout), `--echo` (keyless transport smoke). |
| `bamboo completions <shell>` | Print a shell completion script (`bash`/`zsh`/`fish`/`powershell`/`elvish`), e.g. `bamboo completions zsh > ~/.zfunc/_bamboo`. |
| `bamboo actor run\|serve\|list\|call` | Drive the sub-agent actor fabric from the terminal (spawn + stream, run as a service, discover, or send a task). |
| `bamboo broker serve` | Run the standalone sub-agent message broker (WebSocket bus over durable mailboxes). |
| `bamboo broker-agent serve` | Run a broker-connected agent (local / Docker / remote) that answers Ask/Task for its mailbox. |
| `bamboo health` | Probe a running server's `/health` (exit non-zero if unreachable/unhealthy — usable as a readiness check). |
| `bamboo status` | One-screen overview of a running server: address, health, session counts. |
| `bamboo sessions` | List sessions on a running server (stop one with `bamboo stop <id>`). |
| `bamboo stop <session_id>` | Stop a running session's agent loop. |
| `bamboo history <session_id>` | Print a session's message transcript from a running server (review a headless `-p` run's log); reports the true message total and notes when cold history is capped. |
| `bamboo respond <session_id> [<answer>\|--pending]` | Answer a session's pending question / permission gate out-of-band — the run resumes server-side (e.g. unblock a headless or scheduled run). `--pending [--json]` prints the waiting question and its options instead. |
| `bamboo session show\|delete <id>` | Per-session lifecycle: `show [--json]` prints one session's detail (model, status, pending question, placement…); `delete` removes it (confirms unless `--yes`; running descendants are cancelled first). |
| `bamboo schedules list\|show\|create\|delete\|run\|runs` | Manage schedules (timed tasks) on a running server: list/inspect, create (`--cron`/`--every`/`--daily` + `--prompt`, or a raw `--json <file\|->` payload), delete (confirms unless `--yes`), trigger now, and view run history. |
| `bamboo skills list` | List the skills the agent would load from `<data_dir>/skills` (offline; no server needed). |
| `bamboo mcp list` | List the MCP servers configured in `config.json` (offline; no server needed). |
| `bamboo mcp status\|connect\|disconnect\|refresh\|tools\|add\|remove` | Manage MCP servers on a running instance over `/api/v1/mcp`: live connection state + tool counts (`status [--json]`), enable/connect + disable/disconnect a server, re-list tools (`refresh [<id>]`), inspect tools (`tools [<id>] [--json]`), add from a raw JSON payload (`add --json <file\|->`), and delete (`remove <id>`, confirms unless `--yes`; a removed server can be re-added with `add`). |

TUI bindings are context-aware and configurable with `--keymap`; see
[TUI keybindings](docs/tui-keybindings.md) for the JSON schema, safety rules,
and terminal fallbacks.

The admin commands (`health` / `status` / `sessions` / `stop` / `history` / `respond` / `session` / `schedules`) are thin HTTP clients over a running `bamboo serve`; point them at a non-default server with `--server-url` / `--port` / `--data-dir`. The read commands (`skills list` / `mcp list`) work offline against `--data-dir` (default `~/.bamboo`); the other `mcp` verbs are server-backed and take the same connection flags. (`bamboo subagent-worker` also exists but is an internal worker process spawned by the server — not for interactive use.)

A global `--log-level <error|warn|info|debug|trace>` sets the default log level for any command when `RUST_LOG` is unset (`RUST_LOG` still wins when present). `bamboo serve` defaults to `info` in every build profile. Embedded debug builds keep `debug` on stdout while date-rotated files default to `info`; at startup, strictly matching historical files are retained by both count and a 128 MiB total byte budget. Daily rotation continues during long-running processes, and startup limits are enforced again on the next process start. Use `--log-level debug`, `-v`, or `RUST_LOG` to opt into more detail; target-specific directives such as `RUST_LOG=h2=debug` override the dependency-noise defaults while leaving each sink's root default unchanged.

**Defaults** (verified against code):

- HTTP API: `http://127.0.0.1:9562/api/v1` (port defaults to `9562`, bind defaults to `127.0.0.1`)
- Health: `GET /api/v1/health`
- Data dir: `BAMBOO_DATA_DIR` or `${HOME}/.bamboo`
- Default provider: `anthropic`

**Search-index upgrade:** Before upgrading `session_search.db` from schema 3 to 4, stop all older Bamboo servers, workers, and embedded writers that share the data directory. Startup migrates this derived search cache in one atomic transaction; a failed migration preserves the previous schema and cache contents. Running old and new writers together during a rolling upgrade is unsupported because older writers can reset the schema version and do not preserve the new search row identities. Canonical session data is unchanged; do not delete it to perform or recover this upgrade.

### Call the agent loop

Once the server is running, driving the **full agent loop** — the LLM plans, calls tools, and streams its work — is three HTTP calls: create the turn with `POST /api/v1/chat`, **start the loop** with `POST /api/v1/execute/{session_id}`, then watch the SSE feed `GET /api/v1/events/{session_id}`.

```bash
# 1. Create a turn. This PERSISTS the message and returns immediately — it does
#    NOT run the loop yet. Response includes the session id and events URL:
#    { "session_id": "...", "stream_url": "/api/v1/events/<id>", "status": "streaming" }
CHAT_KEY=$(uuidgen)
SID=$(curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9562/api/v1/chat \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: $CHAT_KEY" \
  -d '{"message":"List the files here and tell me what this project does.","model":"claude-sonnet-4-6"}' \
  | jq -r .session_id)

# 2. Start the agent loop for that session. The body may be empty ({}) — every
#    field (model/provider/skill_mode/reasoning_effort/…) is an optional override.
EXECUTE_KEY=$(uuidgen)
curl -s -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:9562/api/v1/execute/$SID" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: $EXECUTE_KEY" \
  -d '{}'

# 3. Watch the loop in real time (SSE): assistant text, tool calls, tool results,
#    token usage, and completion arrive as they happen.
curl -N "http://127.0.0.1:9562/api/v1/events/$SID"
```

On `POST /api/v1/chat`, `message` and `model` are the only required fields; useful optionals are `session_id` (continue a conversation), `system_prompt`, `selected_skill_ids`, `workspace_path`, `provider`, `images`. Note that `chat` only **persists** the turn — you must then `POST /api/v1/execute/{session_id}` to actually run the loop. Besides the per-session `GET /api/v1/events/{session_id}` feed, there is an account-wide, resumable change feed `GET /api/v1/stream` (SSE, resumable via `?since=<seq>` or the `Last-Event-ID` header) that streams events across **all** sessions — handy for multi-session sync.

`POST /api/v1/chat` and `POST /api/v1/execute/{session_id}` accept an optional
`Idempotency-Key` header. Bamboo keeps up to 1,024 completed responses in memory
for 10 minutes: an equivalent retry replays the first response without
duplicating the message or run, while the same key with a different payload
returns `409`. Keys are scoped independently to chat and execute, and a server
restart clears these short-lived receipts. `POST /api/v1/sessions` has a
separate durable recovery contract documented in
[`docs/session-create-idempotency.md`](docs/session-create-idempotency.md).

### Use it as a Rust SDK (in-process)

No server needed — the **same agent loop** runs in-process. The `bamboo_sdk` crate is an ergonomic **facade** over the engine: you supply a model and an instruction, `.with_defaults_for_data_dir` wires the eight runtime dependencies (storage, persistence, attachment reader, skills, metrics, config, provider, default tools) from `~/.bamboo`, and then `agent.run(&mut session, input)` drives one turn (draining events internally) while `agent.run_stream(session, input)` streams `AgentEvent`s back over an `mpsc` channel. To **interrupt** a streaming run, use `run_stream_cancellable(...)` which also returns a `CancellationToken` (call `.cancel()` to stop the loop); `run_with_cancel` / `run_session_with_cancel` accept a caller-owned token for the non-streaming path. Select the provider ergonomically with `.provider_name("openai")` on the builder (a following `.api_key(...)` applies to it). Every call funnels into the engine's single canonical execution path — the facade never forks the loop. The ergonomic types live in `bamboo_sdk::agent` (`Agent`, `AgentBuilder`, `ExecuteRequestBuilder`, `CancellationToken`, plus re-exported `AgentEvent`, `Session`, …).

```rust
use bamboo_sdk::agent::{Agent, Session};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let home = dirs::home_dir().unwrap().join(".bamboo");

    // Build the agent. One call assembles storage, persistence, skills,
    // metrics, the provider (from ~/.bamboo/config.json), and the default
    // built-in tool set — no manual dependency wiring.
    let agent = Agent::builder()
        .model("claude-sonnet-4-6")
        .instruction("You are a helpful coding agent.")
        .with_defaults_for_data_dir(home)
        .await
        .expect("wire runtime deps")
        .build()
        .expect("agent fully configured");

    // Stream one turn: `run_stream` appends the user message, runs the loop on
    // a background task, and hands back a receiver of AgentEvents.
    let session = Session::new("demo-session", "claude-sonnet-4-6");
    let mut rx = agent.run_stream(
        session,
        "List the files here and tell me what this project does.",
    );
    while let Some(event) = rx.recv().await {
        println!("{event:?}"); // assistant text, tool calls, tool results, token usage, completion
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

> **Precondition:** `with_defaults_for_data_dir` reads `~/.bamboo/config.json` (the same config `bamboo serve` uses) and needs the active provider configured with a non-empty `api_key` — otherwise provider creation returns an error (here surfaced by `.expect`). A fresh data dir with no `config.json` defaults to `anthropic` with no key and will fail; `copilot` is the only provider that authenticates keyless (cached OAuth). Fix it with `bamboo init` (or `bamboo config set providers.<p>.api_key …`), or pass `.api_key("sk-…")` on the builder before `with_defaults_for_data_dir`.

> Don't need the event stream? `agent.run(&mut session, input).await?` drives the turn to completion and leaves the answer as the last message on `session`. For full control over per-request overrides (split fast/background/summarization models, skill selection, provider handles, …) build an `ExecuteRequest` with `ExecuteRequestBuilder` (both re-exported from `bamboo_sdk::agent`) and call `agent.execute(&mut session, req)` — the same canonical engine path `run` / `run_stream` funnel into.

**Approval / clarification + resume.** A run can pause mid-loop waiting for input — from a custom `NeedsHuman` tool or a gated tool call under a configured `PermissionChecker` — surfaced as `AgentEvent::NeedClarification` / `ToolApprovalRequested`. Resolve it with `agent.answer(session_id, "Approve").await?` (the in-process equivalent of the HTTP `POST /sessions/{id}/respond` endpoint — same use-case function under the hood, so behavior matches exactly), then continue with `agent.resume_stream(outcome.session)` / `agent.resume(&mut session)` — or do both in one call with `agent.answer_and_resume_stream(session_id, "Approve").await?`. `AnswerOutcome` also carries any plan-mode transition and the permission grants an approval implied (auto-applied to the builder's `.permission_checker(...)`, if one was configured). When the approved question was a gated tool call, resuming also **re-executes that tool for real** — against the agent's own tool executor — and writes the genuine output back over the synthetic placeholder before the loop continues, matching the HTTP server's behavior exactly (no extra call needed).
>
> A separate mechanism, `AgentEvent::ChildApprovalRequested`, covers an out-of-process CHILD sub-agent's gated tool (only reachable if you've also wired the engine's actor/broker transport — `with_defaults_for_data_dir` does not). Answer those with `agent.answer_child_approval(child_session_id, request_id, approved)` instead of `agent.answer`.

**Permission and tool policy.** `.permission_mode(PermissionMode::Plan | AcceptEdits | DontAsk | Default | BypassPermissions | Auto)` installs Bamboo's standard permission stack. `Auto` emits no approval prompts while retaining explicit policy and platform denials; the typed `BypassPermissions` mode still honors forced confirmations. `.permission_checker(custom)` supplies a custom implementation. In contrast, the SDK-specific `.bypass_permissions()` shortcut explicitly selects its historical no-checker, fully ungated behavior; it is not equivalent to `.permission_mode(PermissionMode::BypassPermissions)`. These three setters are last-call-wins even across `with_defaults_for_data_dir(...).await?`. Leaving `.tools(...)` unset exposes the assembled built-in (+ MCP) surface, while `.tools([])` or `.no_tools()` intentionally creates a zero-tool agent; any explicit tool selection has final precedence over assembled or injected default executors. A fully injected `.default_tools(...)` executor owns its own permission behavior and is not wrapped by the SDK policy setters.

**Session ergonomics.** `agent.new_session(id)` creates a session from the explicit builder model or effective provider-config model, while `agent.load_session(id)`, `agent.list_sessions()` (most-recently-updated first), `agent.session_history(id)`, and `agent.delete_session(id)` cover the common persistence operations. `agent.get_session(id)` remains a compatibility alias for `load_session`. `list_sessions` needs the concrete session-index handle `with_defaults_for_data_dir` assembles.

**MCP.** `.mcp_server(config)` / `.mcp_servers([...])` on the builder connect MCP servers (in `with_defaults_for_data_dir`) and merge their tools into the built-in tool surface via `CompositeToolExecutor` — each server's `initialize` instructions are folded into the tool guidance automatically.

**Dependency override order.** Explicit `.provider(...)`, `.config(...)`, and `.default_tools(...)` injections override defaults whether called before or after `with_defaults_for_data_dir`; an injected provider present before defaults also skips redundant config-driven provider creation. Explicit `.tools(...)` / `.no_tools()` remains the final tool-executor policy.

**Typed errors.** `with_defaults_for_data_dir` / `build` / `answer` / the session-ergonomics methods all return `Result<_, SdkError>` — a `thiserror` enum (`ProviderInit`, `UnsupportedApiKeyProvider`, `ModelNotConfigured`, `StoreInit`, `SkillInit`, `McpServerStart`, `SessionNotFound`, `NoPendingQuestion`, `InvalidResponse`, …) instead of a bare `String`, so callers can match on the failure kind. `UnsupportedApiKeyProvider` makes `.api_key(...)` on `copilot`/unknown providers fail explicitly instead of warning and continuing; `ModelNotConfigured` prevents `new_session` from fabricating an empty model. `SdkError` also wraps `AgentError` (`#[from]`) so it composes with `run`/`run_stream`'s existing typed error in a function returning `Result<_, SdkError>`.

Add the facade crate as a dependency (path or git):

```toml
[dependencies]
bamboo-sdk = { git = "https://github.com/bigduu/Bamboo-agent" }
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
dirs = "5"
anyhow = "1"
```

> Prefer not to manage these dependencies yourself? Run `bamboo serve` and use the server APIs above — they drive the exact same loop. The full SDK type reference is the rustdoc at [docs.rs/bamboo-agent](https://docs.rs/bamboo-agent) (the published crate re-exports the facade as `bamboo_agent::agent`); [`docs/guides/API.md`](./docs/guides/API.md) covers the HTTP/WebSocket/SSE surface.

### Example configuration

The easiest way to create this is `bamboo init` (see [First-run setup](#first-run-setup)), which writes it for you and encrypts the key. The equivalent file at `${HOME}/.bamboo/config.json`:

```json
{
  "provider": "anthropic",
  "server": {
    "port": 9562,
    "bind": "127.0.0.1"
  },
  "providers": {
    "anthropic": {
      "api_key": "sk-ant-...",
      "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6"
    }
  }
}
```

> Config precedence: file < environment variables < CLI arguments. Environment variables include `BAMBOO_DATA_DIR`, `BAMBOO_PORT`, `BAMBOO_BIND`, `BAMBOO_PROVIDER`, `BAMBOO_WORKERS`, `BAMBOO_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS`, and per-provider keys `BAMBOO_OPENAI_API_KEY` / `BAMBOO_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `BAMBOO_GEMINI_API_KEY` (supplied at runtime, never persisted to disk — for Docker/CI/secret-manager deploys without a plaintext key in `config.json`).
>
> This is a minimal example. For every key (multi-provider instances, MCP servers, memory/auto-dream/gardener, sub-agents + the `claude_code` executor, the IM `connect` bridge, `plugin_trust`, notifications, keyword masking, and the full env var list), see [`docs/config-reference.md`](./docs/config-reference.md).

### Docker

```bash
cd docker && docker compose up -d --build
curl http://localhost:9562/api/v1/health
```

`docker-compose.yml` publishes to the host loopback only (`127.0.0.1:9562:9562`), runs as a non-root user, drops all capabilities, and uses an isolated named volume. **Do not widen the publish to expose the agent directly on a network:** a fresh instance is unauthenticated, and the server treats every private-LAN (RFC1918) peer as trusted-local and skips the password check by design — so LAN exposure is unauthenticated even after you set a password. To reach it from other machines, keep the loopback publish and front it with an authenticating reverse proxy on a trusted network. It also sets `BAMBOO_DATA_DIR=/data`, `BAMBOO_PORT=9562`, `BAMBOO_BIND=0.0.0.0` (in-container bind; exposure is controlled at the publish layer).

### Selected API routes

REST prefix `/api/v1`: `chat`, `execute/{session_id}`, `stream`, `sessions`, `skills`, `tools`, `tools/execute`, `models`, `commands`, `workflows`, `metrics/*`, `mcp`, `servers`, `stop/{session_id}`, `health`.
The shared live transport is WebSocket `/v2/stream`; `/api/v1/stream` and `/api/v1/events/{session_id}` remain the legacy SSE feeds.
There are also provider-compatible endpoints: `/openai/v1`, `/anthropic/v1`, `/gemini/v1beta`, `/v1/{chat/completions,responses,messages}`.

### Tests & quality

```bash
cargo test            # workspace tests
cargo clippy          # lints (.clippy.toml present)
cargo build --release
```
